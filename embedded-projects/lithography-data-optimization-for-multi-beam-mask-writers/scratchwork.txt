Example Code:
Below is a simplified example code demonstrating a parallel processing approach for lithography data generation using Python's multiprocessing module:

python

import multiprocessing

def generate_lithography_data(chunk):
    # Function to generate lithography data for a given chunk of input
    pass

def process_input_data(input_data):
    # Function to preprocess input data before lithography data generation
    pass

def main(input_data):
    # Preprocess input data
    input_data = process_input_data(input_data)
    
    # Divide input data into chunks
    num_chunks = multiprocessing.cpu_count()
    chunks = [input_data[i::num_chunks] for i in range(num_chunks)]
    
    # Generate lithography data in parallel
    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=num_chunks) as pool:
        lithography_data = pool.map(generate_lithography_data, chunks)
    
    # Aggregate lithography data from different chunks
    aggregated_data = aggregate_data(lithography_data)
    
    return aggregated_data

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example input data
    input_data = ...
    
    # Generate lithography data
    result = main(input_data)
    print(result)

In this example:

    The main function orchestrates the lithography data generation process by dividing the input data into chunks and generating lithography data for each chunk in parallel using Python's multiprocessing.Pool.
    The generate_lithography_data function represents the actual algorithm for lithography data generation, which can be optimized and parallelized based on specific requirements.
    Other functions such as process_input_data and aggregate_data handle preprocessing of input data and aggregation of generated lithography data, respectively.
    This approach enables efficient utilization of multiple CPU cores and improves the overall performance of the lithography data generation process for multi-beam mask writers.
