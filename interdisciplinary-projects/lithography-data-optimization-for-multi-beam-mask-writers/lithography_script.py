"""lithography_script.py

Description:

Imports: The script starts by importing the necessary modules: multiprocessing for parallel processing and csv for handling CSV files.

Input File Definition: The variable INPUT_FILE specifies the path to the input CSV file containing the raw data.
generate_lithography_data Function: This function generates lithography data for a given chunk of input data.
Currently, it's a dummy function and should be replaced with the actual implementation. It calculates a simplistic
lithography metric based on feature dimensions and conductivity.
process_input_data Function: This function processes the input data from the CSV file. It reads the CSV file, parses
each row, and constructs a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a feature with its attributes.

aggregate_data Function: This function aggregates lithography data from different chunks. It receives a list of
data chunks, each containing lithography data for a subset of features, and aggregates them into a single dictionary,
where each key is a feature ID and the corresponding value is the aggregated lithography data for that feature.

main Function: This is the main function that orchestrates the processing pipeline. It first preprocesses the input
data, then divides it into chunks based on the number of available CPU cores. Next, it generates lithography data for
each chunk in parallel using multiprocessing. Finally, it aggregates the generated lithography data from different chunks.

Script Execution: The script checks if it's being run as the main program (if __name__ == "__main__":). If so, it
initializes example input data (which should be replaced with actual input data), calls the main function to generate
lithography data, and prints the result.
