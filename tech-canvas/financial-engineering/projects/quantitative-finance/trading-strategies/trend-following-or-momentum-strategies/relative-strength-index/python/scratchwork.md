The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between 0 and 100 and is typically used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market. The RSI trading strategy is based on the principle that when the RSI value exceeds certain thresholds, it may indicate potential trend reversals or corrections in price.

### How the Relative Strength Index (RSI) Works:

1. **Calculation of RSI**: RSI is calculated based on the average gain and average loss over a specified period, usually 14 days for traditional settings. The formula for calculating RSI is:

   \[
   \text{RSI} = 100 - \left( \frac{100}{1 + RS} \right)
   \]

   where RS (Relative Strength) is the ratio of average gain to average loss over the specified period.

2. **Interpretation of RSI Values**:
   - RSI values above 70 are typically considered overbought, suggesting that the asset may be overvalued and a potential reversal or correction may occur.
   - RSI values below 30 are typically considered oversold, suggesting that the asset may be undervalued and a potential reversal or bounce-back may occur.

3. **Trading Signals**:
   - **Overbought Conditions**: When the RSI value crosses above the 70 threshold, it may indicate that the asset is overbought, and a reversal or correction in price may be imminent. Traders may consider selling or shorting the asset.
   - **Oversold Conditions**: When the RSI value crosses below the 30 threshold, it may indicate that the asset is oversold, and a potential reversal or bounce-back in price may occur. Traders may consider buying or going long on the asset.

4. **Confirmation and Risk Management**:
   - RSI signals are more reliable when they are confirmed by other technical indicators or chart patterns.
   - Traders should always use proper risk management techniques, such as setting stop-loss orders, to manage their positions.

5. **Limitations**:
   - RSI is a lagging indicator, meaning it may not always provide timely signals, especially in strongly trending markets.
   - False signals can occur, especially in choppy or range-bound markets.

In summary, the RSI trading strategy is based on identifying overbought and oversold conditions in a market using the Relative Strength Index indicator. Traders use RSI signals to make buy or sell decisions, but they should always consider other factors and use proper risk management techniques when executing trades.
