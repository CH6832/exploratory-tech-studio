python

from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute

# Create a quantum circuit with 2 qubits
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)

# Apply Hadamard gate to the first qubit
qc.h(0)

# Apply CNOT gate with control qubit 0 and target qubit 1
qc.cx(0, 1)

# Measure qubits and store results in classical bits
qc.measure([0, 1], [0, 1])

# Simulate the quantum circuit
simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
job = execute(qc, simulator, shots=1000)
result = job.result()

# Get counts of measurement outcomes
counts = result.get_counts(qc)
print("Measurement outcome counts:", counts)

This code creates a simple quantum circuit with two qubits, applies a Hadamard gate to the first qubit and a CNOT gate between the two qubits, and then measures the qubits. Finally, it simulates the circuit using Qiskit's QASM simulator and prints the measurement outcomes.

You can further expand this example by implementing more complex quantum circuits, experimenting with different quantum gates, or simulating quantum algorithms. This repository can serve as a comprehensive resource for learning and experimenting with quantum computing concepts using Python.

Ccomplex example of a quantum circuit implementing Grover's algorithm for unstructured search using Qiskit:

python

from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute

# Define the number of qubits and iterations for Grover's algorithm
n = 3  # Number of qubits
iterations = 2  # Number of Grover iterations

# Create a quantum circuit with n qubits and n classical bits
qc = QuantumCircuit(n, n)

# Apply Hadamard gates to all qubits
qc.h(range(n))

# Apply oracle: mark the solution state (in this case, |110>)
qc.x(0)
qc.x(1)

qc.cz(0, 2)

qc.x(0)
qc.x(1)

# Apply Hadamard gates again
qc.h(range(n))

# Apply diffusion operator
qc.z(range(n))
qc.cz(0, 1)
qc.h(2)

# Measure qubits
qc.measure(range(n), range(n))

# Simulate the quantum circuit
simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
job = execute(qc, simulator, shots=1000)
result = job.result()

# Get counts of measurement outcomes
counts = result.get_counts(qc)
print("Measurement outcome counts:", counts)

This code implements Grover's algorithm to search for the solution state |110>. It starts by applying Hadamard gates to all qubits to create a superposition of all possible states. Then, it applies the oracle to mark the solution state. Afterward, it applies Hadamard gates again and the diffusion operator to amplify the probability of the solution state. Finally, it measures the qubits to obtain the result.

You can adjust the number of qubits and iterations to experiment with different problem sizes and explore the capabilities of Grover's algorithm for quantum search.

Adjust the number of qubits and iterations to explore different problem sizes with Grover's algorithm. Here's an example with 4 qubits and 3 iterations:

python

from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute

# Define the number of qubits and iterations for Grover's algorithm
n = 4  # Number of qubits
iterations = 3  # Number of Grover iterations

# Create a quantum circuit with n qubits and n classical bits
qc = QuantumCircuit(n, n)

# Apply Hadamard gates to all qubits
qc.h(range(n))

# Apply oracle: mark the solution state (in this case, |1110>)
qc.x(0)
qc.x(1)
qc.x(2)

qc.cz(0, 3)

qc.x(0)
qc.x(1)
qc.x(2)

# Apply Hadamard gates again
qc.h(range(n))

# Apply diffusion operator
qc.z(range(n))
qc.cz(0, 1)
qc.h(2)
qc.cz(2, 3)

# Measure qubits
qc.measure(range(n), range(n))

# Simulate the quantum circuit
simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
job = execute(qc, simulator, shots=1000)
result = job.result()

# Get counts of measurement outcomes
counts = result.get_counts(qc)
print("Measurement outcome counts:", counts)

With this adjustment, we're now searching for the solution state |1110> using a 4-qubit quantum circuit and 3 Grover iterations. You can further modify the number of qubits and iterations to experiment with different problem sizes and explore the capabilities of Grover's algorithm for quantum search.
