Example Code:
Below is a simplified example code demonstrating a physics-based simulation of electron scattering in the multi-beam mask writer's datapath:

python

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def simulate_electron_scattering(beam_energy, beam_current, mask_material, substrate_material):
    # Simulate electron scattering in the mask writer's datapath
    # Model interaction of electrons with mask and substrate materials
    # Return simulated pattern on the substrate
    
    # Example simulation code (simplified)
    pattern = np.random.rand(100, 100)  # Simulated pattern
    
    return pattern

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example simulation parameters
    beam_energy = 100  # Beam energy in keV
    beam_current = 1e-6  # Beam current in A
    mask_material = "SiO2"  # Mask material
    substrate_material = "Si"  # Substrate material
    
    # Simulate electron scattering
    pattern = simulate_electron_scattering(beam_energy, beam_current, mask_material, substrate_material)
    
    # Visualize simulation results
    plt.imshow(pattern, cmap='gray')
    plt.title('Simulated Pattern on Substrate')
    plt.colorbar()
    plt.show()

In this example:

    The simulate_electron_scattering function simulates the interaction of electrons with the mask and substrate materials in the multi-beam mask writer's datapath.
    The simulation model accounts for factors such as beam energy, beam current, and material properties to generate a simulated pattern on the substrate.
    Simulation results are visualized using Matplotlib to analyze the pattern generated on the substrate and evaluate the performance of the multi-beam mask writer's datapath.

This project provides a foundation for developing complex physics-based simulations of multi-beam mask writer systems, enabling optimization of system parameters and continuous improvement of tool generations through simulation-based insights.
