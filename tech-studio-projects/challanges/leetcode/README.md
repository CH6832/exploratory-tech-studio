# LeetCode

Welcome to the **LeetCode Solutions** repository! ðŸŽ¯ This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode coding challenges, organized into three difficulty levels: `easy`, `medium`, and `hard`. These solutions are all challenges I have successfully completed.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured into three main directories, each corresponding to the difficulty level of the problems:

- **easy/** â€“ Solutions to problems classified as "Easy" on LeetCode. These problems are typically introductory-level and help build fundamental problem-solving skills.
  
- **medium/** â€“ Solutions to problems that require a deeper understanding of algorithms and data structures. These problems often involve more complex logic and optimizations.
  
- **hard/** â€“ Solutions to problems that are quite challenging, often requiring advanced problem-solving strategies, optimizations, and efficient use of resources.

Each folder contains individual solution files, generally following the format `problem_name.extension` (e.g., `two_sum.py`).

## How to Use

You can explore the solutions by browsing through the folders. The problem title in the file name generally corresponds to the official title on LeetCode. You can refer to LeetCode to find the problem statements.

## Technologies Used

The solutions are primarily written in:

- Python
- Java
