# HackerRank

Welcome to the **HackerRank Solutions** repository! ðŸŽ¯ This repository contains my solutions to various HackerRank coding challenges, organized by domains and difficulty levels. All the challenges included here have been successfully solved in C++.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured into directories corresponding to HackerRank's problem domains and categories, such as **Algorithms**, **Data Structures**, and **Problem Solving**. Within each domain, problems are further categorized based on difficulty: `medium` and `hard`.

### Repository Structure:

  - `medium/` â€“ Intermediate-level problems requiring deeper understanding of algorithms.

  - `hard/` â€“ Advanced problems demanding complex strategies and optimizations.

Each folder contains individual solution files, typically following the format `problem_name.cpp` (e.g., `array_left_rotation.cpp`).

## How to Use

Browse through the directories to find solutions. Each file name corresponds to the official title of the problem on HackerRank. You can visit [HackerRank's website](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp?filters%5Bstatus%5D%5B%5D=unsolved) to view the problem statements and test the solutions provided here.

### Running the Solutions

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++).

2. Compile and run a solution file:
   ```bash
   g++ -o solution problem_name.cpp
   ./solution
   ```

## Technologies Used

The solutions are primarily written in:

- C++
