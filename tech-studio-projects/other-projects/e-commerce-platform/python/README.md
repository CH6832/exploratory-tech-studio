# E-Commerce Platform

## Overview

This is a scalable and modular e-commerce platform built using a microservices architecture. The project consists of several independent services, each handling specific functionalities within the e-commerce ecosystem. The frontend is developed using React.js, and the backend is powered by Flask.

### Features

- **Product Management**: Admins can create, update, and delete products.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add, view, and remove items from their shopping carts.
- **Order Management**: Handles order creation, payment processing, and order cancellation.
- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login with JWT token-based authentication.
- **Product Reviews**: Users can leave and view reviews for products.
- **Inventory Management**: Admins can monitor and update stock levels.
- **User Activity Logging**: Tracks user interactions for analytics and personalization.
- **Shipping Management**: Calculates shipping costs and tracks shipments.
- **Content Management**: Manage static content such as blog posts and promotional banners.

## Architecture

The project is structured into multiple microservices, each running independently and communicating via RESTful APIs. Here’s the high-level architecture:

```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine.
- **Docker Compose**: This comes with Docker Desktop, but you can also install it separately.

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce_project.git
   cd ecommerce_project
   ```

2. **Build and start the services**:

   Using Docker Compose, you can build and run all services with a single command:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This will build the images and start all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml`.

3. **Access the application**:

   - The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
   - The backend services will be available at their respective ports, e.g.:
     - Order Service: `http://localhost:5001`
     - Auth Service: `http://localhost:5002`
     - Cart Service: `http://localhost:5003`
     - And so on...

### API Documentation

The APIs for each service are documented in their respective service folders. You can use tools like Postman or cURL to test the endpoints.

### Environment Variables

You can configure environment variables for each service in the `docker-compose.yml` file. Make sure to set the necessary keys such as `SECRET_KEY` and database URIs as needed.

### Testing

You can add unit tests and integration tests for each service. Consider using `pytest` or similar testing frameworks to ensure the quality of your services.

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.

## Conclusion

This e-commerce platform is designed to be extensible and scalable, allowing you to add features and services as your requirements grow. Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and enhance it for your specific use cases!

# E-Commerce API Documentation

## Overview

The E-Commerce API provides a set of endpoints for managing an online store, including product management, user authentication, shopping cart operations, order processing, reviews, and inventory management. This API is built using Flask and follows RESTful principles.

## Base URL

```
http://localhost:5000/api
```

## Authentication

### JWT Authentication

All endpoints (except for authentication) require a JSON Web Token (JWT) for access. The token is obtained via the login endpoint and must be included in the `Authorization` header as follows:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
