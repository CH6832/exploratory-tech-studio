# Brainstorming

## Problem to Solve:
The goal of this e-commerce platform is to provide a simple yet effective online store where users can browse products, manage a shopping cart, and make payments. We aim to design an intuitive, easy-to-navigate system while integrating standard Java technologies like JSP, Servlets, and JDBC.

## Features to Consider:
1. **User Experience**:
   - Clean, user-friendly design with easy-to-navigate pages.
   - Cart management system that allows users to easily modify quantities and remove items.
   - Secure and reliable payment processing system with clear error handling.

2. **Scalability**:
   - Ensure the platform can handle multiple users and transactions.
   - Look into implementing clustering or load balancing for high traffic.

3. **Payment Gateway**:
   - Integrate real payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal) once the prototype is functional.
   - Ensure that payment information is securely handled and stored.

4. **Security**:
   - Encrypt user passwords before storing them in the database.
   - Implement HTTPS for secure communication, especially for payment processing.

5. **Database**:
   - Consider implementing a more complex database schema, such as adding product categories, product reviews, or user roles (e.g., admin, customer).
   - Use prepared statements in `DBConnection.java` to avoid SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Technology Choices:
- Using Java EE (Jakarta EE) for the backend was a solid choice as it provides a robust platform for enterprise-level applications.
- Initially, the project uses a basic simulation for payment processing. Later, we could implement a third-party payment provider API.
- Using Apache Tomcat as a servlet container ensures that the application is lightweight and compatible with various Java platforms.

## Potential Improvements:
1. **Adding Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Implement roles (admin/customer) for restricting access to certain pages (e.g., admin can manage products).
   - Introduce session timeout or user logout functionality.
   
2. **Search and Filter**:
   - Add product search functionality, allowing users to search for products by name, category, or price range.
   - Introduce product filtering options.

3. **Mobile Optimization**:
   - Consider making the platform responsive or creating a mobile app version of the platform.

4. **Performance Enhancements**:
   - Look into caching frequently accessed product data to reduce database load.
   - Consider integrating a content delivery network (CDN) for faster page load times.
