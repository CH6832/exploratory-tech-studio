- **Password Recovery**: Users can reset their passwords via email verification.
- **User Activity Logging**: Track user activities within the system for auditing purposes.

### 3.2 Packet Sniffing
- **Network Interface Selection**: Allow users to select the network interface for monitoring.
- **Real-Time Packet Capture**: Continuously capture network packets.
- **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Implement algorithms to detect anomalies based on predefined rules or patterns.
- **Protocol Analysis**: Analyze common protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) for potential vulnerabilities.
- **Data Normalization**: Normalize captured data for easier analysis.

### 3.3 Log Analysis
- **Log File Upload**: Users can upload log files for analysis.
- **Suspicious Log Entry Detection**: Analyze logs for suspicious activities based on keywords or patterns.
- **Log Parsing**: Support parsing of various log formats (e.g., Apache, Nginx, system logs).
- **Display Analysis Results**: Show results of the log analysis, highlighting detected issues.
- **Integration with External Log Sources**: Ability to pull logs from cloud services or third-party tools.

### 3.4 Alert Management
- **Alert Generation**: Automatically generate alerts for detected suspicious activities.
- **View Alerts**: Users can view all alerts, including their details.
- **Alert Filtering**: Allow users to filter alerts based on criteria such as date, severity, and type.
- **Alert Notifications**: Implement email or SMS notifications for critical alerts.
- **Alert History**: Maintain a history of alerts for future reference.

### 3.5 Reporting
- **Export Alerts**: Provide options to export alerts in various formats (e.g., PDF, CSV).
- **Generate Reports**: Create summary reports of detected activities over a specified period.
- **Dashboard**: Create a visual dashboard to present key metrics (e.g., number of alerts, types of detected threats).
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate reports to meet regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should handle a high volume of traffic without significant latency (e.g., < 2 seconds for packet capture).
- **Scalability**: The solution should be able to scale horizontally to accommodate increasing traffic and data.
- **Security**: Sensitive data should be encrypted, and proper security measures must be implemented to protect user accounts (e.g., SSL/TLS).
- **Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive and user-friendly.
- **Maintainability**: The codebase should be structured for easy maintenance and updates.
- **Availability**: The system should have a minimum uptime of 99.9%.
- **Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with various cloud platforms and environments.

## 5. Cloud Environment and Usage

### 5.1 Supported Cloud Providers
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Utilize AWS services such as EC2 for hosting and S3 for log storage.
- **Microsoft Azure**: Leverage Azure resources like Virtual Machines (VMs) and Azure Blob Storage.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Use GCP services like Compute Engine for hosting and Google Cloud Storage for logs.
- **Hybrid Cloud Support**: The system should be capable of operating in both public and private cloud environments.

### 5.2 Deployment Scenarios
- **Single Instance Deployment**: For small environments or initial testing, the IDS can be deployed as a single instance.
- **Cluster Deployment**: For larger environments, deploy the IDS in a cluster configuration to balance the load and ensure high availability.
- **Serverless Deployment**: Explore serverless architectures to reduce operational overhead, using functions to analyze logs or alerts.
- **Containerization**: Use Docker containers for easier deployment and scaling in cloud environments.

### 5.3 Usage Scenarios
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Network administrators can monitor network traffic in real-time to identify potential threats.
- **Post-Mortem Analysis**: After a security incident, users can analyze logs to identify the cause and prevent future incidents.
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate reports to meet compliance requirements for data security (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

## 6. How to Use the IDS to Detect Malicious Behavior

### 6.1 System Configuration
- **Deployment**: Deploy the IDS on a cloud platform of your choice (AWS, Azure, GCP) or on-premises.
- **Network Interface Setup**: Configure the network interface settings to monitor specific network segments.
- **Log Source Configuration**: Integrate log sources from various services for analysis.

### 6.2 Monitoring Network Traffic
- **Packet Sniffing**: Capture and analyze network traffic in real-time.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Set rules to detect unusual patterns, such as excessive failed logins or unauthorized access.

### 6.3 Log Analysis
- **Log Upload and Parsing**: Upload log files and analyze them for suspicious activities.
- **Pattern Matching**: Utilize techniques to find suspicious entries, such as SQL injection attempts.

### 6.4 Alert Generation
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Configure the IDS to generate alerts for detected suspicious activities.
- **Notification System**: Set up email or SMS notifications for critical alerts.

### 6.5 Investigation and Response
- **Alert Dashboard**: Monitor and review all generated alerts.

### 6.7 Continuous Improvement
- **Feedback Loop**: Refine detection rules based on findings from incidents.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep the IDS updated with the latest security patches and threat intelligence.

## 7. Security Considerations
- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data, including user credentials and log files, should be encrypted in transit (using SSL/TLS) and at rest.
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Follow secure coding guidelines to mitigate vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls and RBAC to limit user access to sensitive functionalities.
- **Audit Logs**: Maintain audit logs of all user activities and system changes for accountability and forensic analysis.

## 8. Deployment Strategies
