# JavaFX Browser Project

## :newspaper: About the project

This project is a simple yet powerful web browser application built using JavaFX. It offers a seamless browsing experience, allowing users to browse the web effortlessly, open multiple tabs for simultaneous browsing, navigate backward and forward with ease, refresh pages instantly to ensure the latest content, and enter URLs directly to visit specific websites. I use this browser daily, and it has significantly improved my web browsing efficiency and convenience. Whether you're a developer looking for a customizable browser or someone seeking a straightforward and effective web browsing tool, this project is designed to meet your needs.

## Features

* **Multi-Tab Browsing:** Open and manage multiple tabs effortlessly, allowing you to view and switch between several websites without losing context. This feature creates a smooth and organized browsing experience tailored for multitasking.

* **Enhanced Address Bar with Auto-Completion:** Quickly navigate to websites with our address bar that intuitively auto-completes URLs, including common prefixes (like “https://”) and domain extensions (e.g., “.com,” “.org”). This speeds up navigation and minimizes typing errors.

* **User-Friendly Navigation Controls:** Easily access and retrace your browsing path with forward and backward navigation buttons, so you can revisit or skip past pages in your browsing history with ease.

* **Quick Page Reload:** Refresh any open page with a single click to make sure you’re seeing the latest updates. This instant reload feature is designed for dynamic content and provides seamless updates without disrupting your browsing session.

* **Auto-Updating Tab Titles:** Manage multiple tabs efficiently with tabs that automatically show the title of each website. This dynamic titling keeps your tabs organized, letting you locate and switch between tabs effortlessly.

* **In-Page Text Search (Ctrl + F):** Search for specific content within a webpage with our in-page search function, accessible by pressing Ctrl + F. This lets you find and jump to exact phrases or keywords within seconds.

* **Open in External Browser:** For added flexibility, you can open any website in an external browser of your choice directly from the application, giving you control over your browsing environment and preferences.

* **Convenient Hotkeys for Tab Management (Ctrl + W):** Easily close tabs using the Ctrl + W shortcut, making it quick and simple to manage your open tabs and optimize your workflow.

* **Built-in Performance Profiling:** Monitor and improve browsing performance with integrated profiling tools, which provide insights into resource usage, enabling a smoother and more responsive browsing experience.
