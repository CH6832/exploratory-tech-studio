### **Key Components Breakdown**

1. **User Interface (UI)**:
   - **Web Interface**: A front-end dashboard that allows users to visualize the network topology, configure devices, and view simulation results in real-time.
   - **CLI Interface**: A command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to configure the network, run simulations, and monitor results via terminal commands.

2. **Simulation Engine**:
   The heart of the system, which simulates devices, protocols, and network traffic. It consists of multiple sub-modules:
   - **Device Simulation**: Models the network devices such as routers, switches, and end devices. Each device simulates its behavior, including packet forwarding, routing, and interactions with other devices.
   - **Protocol Simulation**: Simulates the communication protocols between devices, including TCP, UDP, ARP, and DNS. Protocol handling ensures realistic packet exchanges and error handling.
   - **Network Traffic Simulation**: Models the flow of data across the network. It generates traffic patterns for different protocols and measures network performance metrics like latency and packet loss.
   - **Performance Metrics & Fault Simulation**: Monitors the performance of the network and injects faults (e.g., congestion, link failure, delay) into the simulation to analyze the network's robustness under different conditions.

3. **Database (Optional)**:
   Stores configuration settings, simulation results, logs, and device states. This can help in re-running simulations or performing analysis on historical data.

4. **Logging & Reporting**:
   Tracks and logs all simulation activities. It generates reports based on the simulation's outcome, showing network performance metrics like latency, throughput, packet loss, and congestion, among others.

### **3.1 Simulation Engine**

The **Simulation Engine** is where most of the simulation logic resides. It consists of several interacting modules that perform tasks in parallel (using Goâ€™s goroutines) to simulate network activity:

#### **3.1.1 Device Simulation**

Devices (routers, switches, endpoints) are simulated as individual entities in the network. Each device has its own state, configuration, and behavior.

- **Router**: Routes packets based on static or dynamic routing protocols (e.g., RIP, OSPF). Routes are calculated and updated during simulation.
- **Switch**: Forwards frames based on MAC addresses. Simulates VLANs and MAC address table maintenance.
- **End Devices**: Simulates user devices like computers or servers that generate and consume traffic.
