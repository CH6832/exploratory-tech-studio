# **IT Network Simulation System Repository Structure Overview**

The repository structure for the **IT Network Simulation System** will be organized to separate concerns, with each component and feature living in its own directory. This structure also facilitates testing, documentation, and scaling as your project grows.

### **Directory Breakdown**

---

#### **`cmd/`** - Entry Points

- **Purpose**: This directory contains the entry point(s) for running your Go project. Each application or microservice (like a CLI tool or a web service) will have a corresponding directory under `cmd/`.
- **Example**:
  - `simulation/main.go`: The entry point for starting the IT network simulation. This could initialize the network simulator and manage the simulation lifecycle.

---

#### **`internal/`** - Core Logic

- **Purpose**: This is where the core logic of the application resides. The `internal/` directory ensures that these packages are only used within the project and are not accessible from external modules.
- **Subdirectories**:
  - **`devices/`**: Contains logic to simulate different network devices such as routers, switches, and endpoints.
    - `router.go`: Contains logic for simulating routers.
    - `switch.go`: Contains logic for simulating switches.
    - `endpoint.go`: Contains logic for simulating endpoint devices.
  
  - **`protocols/`**: Contains logic to simulate various network protocols like TCP, UDP, ICMP, ARP, and DNS.
    - `tcp.go`, `udp.go`, `icmp.go`, `arp.go`, `dns.go`: Implementation of respective protocol behavior.

  - **`traffic/`**: Manages the traffic generation, flow, and analysis within the simulation.
    - `generator.go`: Generates traffic based on user configuration (e.g., HTTP, FTP).
    - `flow.go`: Defines how traffic flows between devices.
    - `analysis.go`: Analyzes traffic and performance metrics.

  - **`performance/`**: Tracks and manages performance-related aspects of the simulation.
    - `metrics.go`: Measures network metrics like latency, throughput, packet loss, etc.
    - `fault.go`: Handles the injection of network faults (e.g., congestion, link failure).

  - **`topology/`**: Manages network topologies and their configurations.
    - `topology.go`: Defines different network topologies (star, mesh, etc.).
    - `config.go`: Contains configuration definitions for network setup.
    - `manager.go`: Logic for managing and updating the network topology during the simulation.

  - **`simulation/`**: Controls the entire simulation process, from setup to execution and results collection.
    - `controller.go`: Orchestrates the simulation steps.
    - `state.go`: Manages the current state of the simulation.
    - `results.go`: Collects and processes results (e.g., metrics, logs).

---

#### **`pkg/`** - Shared Libraries

- **Purpose**: Contains packages that are shared across your entire project, like database access, logging, and any external APIs.
- **Subdirectories**:
  - **`logger/`**: Handles logging for the system. 
    - `logger.go`: Implements logging utilities for the system.
  - **`db/`**: Database interaction logic.
    - `db.go`: Contains methods to connect and interact with the database.
    - `migrations.go`: Manages database migrations (if applicable).
  - **`api/`**: API layer for external interfaces.
    - `api.go`: API endpoints and routes.
    - `handlers.go`: HTTP request handlers for the API.

---

#### **`web/`** - Web Interface (if applicable)

- **Purpose**: This folder holds the web application code (if you decide to build a web-based UI). 
- **Subdirectories**:
  - **`static/`**: Contains static files like images, stylesheets, and JavaScript.
  - **`templates/`**: Contains HTML templates for rendering dynamic pages.
  - **`main.go`**: The main entry point for the web server.
  - **`handlers/`**: HTTP request handlers for the web interface.

---

#### **`scripts/`** - Utility Scripts

- **Purpose**: This directory stores useful scripts to manage the project, such as setup, build, or run scripts.
- **Example**:
  - `setup.sh`: Script to set up the environment (install dependencies, set configurations).
  - `run_simulation.sh`: A script to run the simulation with various parameters.

---

#### **`test/`** - Test Code

- **Purpose**: This folder holds your unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Each core module should have a corresponding test file.
- **Examples**:
  - `devices_test.go`: Unit tests for the device simulation logic.
  - `protocols_test.go`: Unit tests for the protocol simulation logic.
  - `traffic_test.go`: Tests for network traffic generation and flow.
  - `performance_test.go`: Tests for performance metrics collection and fault injection.
  - `simulation_test.go`: Tests for simulation management and results handling.
  - `integration_test.go`: Tests that check how all components interact together.

---

#### **`docs/`** - Documentation

- **Purpose**: Documentation for the project, including architectural overviews, requirements, and user guides.
- **Files**:
  - `requirements.md`: Contains the detailed project requirements.
  - `architecture.md`: Describes the system architecture and design.
  - `user_guide.md`: A guide for users on how to use the simulation system.

---

#### **Root Directory**

- **go.mod**: Go module definition that manages dependencies and versioning.
- **go.sum**: A checksum file to ensure the integrity of the modules.
- **README.md**: Overview and documentation about the project, how to set it up, and basic usage.
- **LICENSE**: License file for the project.

---

### **Additional Considerations**

- **Modular Design**: As the system grows, you might break down large modules into more specific ones (e.g., separate protocols into more granular parts, such as handling only HTTP traffic or DNS).
- **Testing Coverage**: Ensure that all modules have appropriate unit tests and that integration tests cover the communication between components (e.g., network devices interacting with protocols).
- **CI/CD**: Integrate continuous integration and deployment pipelines using tools like **GitHub Actions** or **GitLab CI** to automate testing, building, and deployment.
