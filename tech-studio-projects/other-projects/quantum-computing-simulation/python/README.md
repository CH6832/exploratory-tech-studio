# Quantum Computing Simulation with Qiskit

This project demonstrates basic quantum computing operations using the Qiskit library in Python. The simulation includes applying quantum gates like Hadamard (H) and Pauli-X (X) to qubits, visualizing their states, and profiling the execution for performance analysis.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
├── main.py
├── quantum_operations.py
├── circuit_execution.py
├── utils.py
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt
```

- **`main.py`**: The entry point for the simulation, orchestrating the quantum operations.
- **`quantum_operations.py`**: Contains functions to apply quantum gates to qubits.
- **`circuit_execution.py`**: Handles the execution of the quantum circuit.
- **`utils.py`**: Contains utility functions for logging, profiling, and other helper tasks.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation (this file).
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of dependencies required to run the project.

## Installation

To run this project, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-simulation.git
cd quantum-simulation
```

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Install Additional Dependencies (if needed)

For visualizations:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

## Usage

Run the simulation by executing the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Expected Output

The script will apply quantum gates to a qubit, log the operations, and display the final quantum state. Profiling information and a Bloch sphere visualization of the final state will also be generated.

## Code Overview

### `main.py`

- **Purpose**: The main script initializes the quantum circuit, applies quantum gates, and executes the circuit. It also handles profiling and logging.

### `quantum_operations.py`

- **Purpose**: Contains functions that apply quantum gates (Hadamard, X) to qubits within a quantum circuit.

### `circuit_execution.py`

- **Purpose**: Handles the execution of the quantum circuit and returns the final statevector.

### `utils.py`

- **Purpose**: Contains utility functions such as logging setup, profiling, and execution time tracking.

### Optimization

The code includes several optimization techniques:

- **Logging**: Tracks the progress of the simulation.
- **Profiling**: Measures the execution time of different parts of the code using `cProfile`.
- **Execution Time Tracking**: Monitors the overall execution time of the simulation.

### Further Development

Potential extensions to this project include:

- Implementing additional quantum gates and operations.
- Expanding the simulation to multi-qubit systems.
- Adding quantum measurement operations and observing state collapse.
- Implementing error correction or noise models using Qiskit Aer.

### Additional Notes

1. **Qiskit Installation**: If you have issues with installing Qiskit, it’s recommended to follow the official installation guide: [Qiskit Installation Guide](https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html).

2. **Virtual Environment**: Using a virtual environment (`venv`) is recommended to manage dependencies cleanly without interfering with other Python projects on your system.

3. **Customization**: You can easily modify the `README.md` and `requirements.txt` to suit the specific needs or additional features of your project.

This setup should provide a clear and professional starting point for your quantum computing project in Python using Qiskit.
