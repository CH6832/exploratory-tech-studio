Explanation of the Diagram

    User Service: This component handles user-related operations such as managing user information and preferences.

    Recommendation Engine: This service processes user interactions and generates movie recommendations based on the data from the user service and the database.

    Notification Service: After recommendations are generated, this service is responsible for notifying users about new recommendations or updates in their recommendation list.

    Kafka: This serves as the message broker, queuing notifications that can be sent by the notification service. It allows for decoupled communication between services.

    MongoDB: This database stores all the movie data and user data necessary for the recommendation engine and user service.

Additional Notes

    Data Flow: Arrows indicate the direction of data flow between components. For instance, the user service communicates with the recommendation engine to provide user preferences, which in turn generates recommendations that are queued in Kafka for notification.

    Microservices Architecture: Each component can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, allowing for a flexible and maintainable architecture.
