# Requirements for Multi-Product Recommendation System

## **Project Overview**
This system is designed to handle high scalability and performance for generating multi-product recommendations without the need for user login. It is a **public-facing** application where multiple users can request product recommendations concurrently. The system will be designed with **microservices architecture**, where each service will be built using different frameworks (Flask, FastAPI, Django) to handle different components of the system. Key goals include **scalability**, **performance**, and **maintainability**.

---

## **Architecture Overview**
The system will be designed using the following microservices:

1. **User Profile Service** (Flask)
2. **Product Catalog Service** (FastAPI)
3. **Recommendation Engine Service** (Django)
4. **API Gateway** (Optional for routing, logging, and rate-limiting)
5. **Database Layer** (Separate databases for each service or a shared database with caching layers)
6. **Caching Layer** (Redis for caching recommendations and product data)

### **Key Characteristics of the System**:
- **Scalability**: The system should scale horizontally to handle high traffic.
- **High Availability**: Ensure availability by distributing load and minimizing single points of failure.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Use asynchronous services to handle high throughput and avoid blocking.
- **Stateless**: Services are stateless, meaning each request is independent.
- **Caching**: Use caching mechanisms to reduce redundant calculations and improve response time.

---

## **Microservices Breakdown**
1. **User Profile Service (Flask)**:
   - Exposes simple API endpoints to provide non-user-specific data (e.g., product preferences).
   - Stateless, light-weight, and simple to scale.
  
2. **Product Catalog Service (FastAPI)**:
   - Exposes high-performance API endpoints to fetch product details (e.g., categories, features, prices).
   - Designed for fast read-heavy operations with asynchronous capabilities.

3. **Recommendation Engine Service (Django)**:
   - Exposes an API endpoint to generate product recommendations based on cached data, user preferences (if available), and product metadata.
   - Might involve more complex algorithms and require heavy computation for personalized recommendations.
   - Django's built-in ORM could be used for handling models or querying product data from databases.

4. **API Gateway**:
   - Routes incoming requests to the appropriate microservice (Flask, FastAPI, Django).
   - Handles features like **rate-limiting**, **request aggregation**, **caching**, and **logging**.
   - **Kong**, **NGINX**, or **Traefik** could be used as the API Gateway.

5. **Database Layer**:
   - Each microservice could have its own database to ensure isolation and allow for specific optimizations. For example:
     - **NoSQL databases** (MongoDB, Cassandra) for product data.
     - **SQL databases** (PostgreSQL) for user profiles or other structured data.
   - Data can be **cached** with **Redis** to minimize database calls and improve response times.

6. **Caching Layer (Redis)**:
   - Store frequently requested product data and recommendation results to reduce load on backend services and speed up response times.

## **Key Requirements**

### **1. Frameworks and Libraries**
- **Flask**: For building lightweight, stateless APIs (e.g., User Profile Service).
- **FastAPI**: For building high-performance, asynchronous APIs (e.g., Product Catalog Service).
- **Django**: For handling more complex data models, ORM, and recommendations (e.g., Recommendation Engine).
- **Redis**: For caching frequently requested data (e.g., product catalogs and recommendations).
- **RabbitMQ** or **Kafka**: For handling asynchronous processing and decoupling of services if background tasks are needed.
- **SQLAlchemy** (or Django ORM) for database interactions.
- **NGINX** or **Kong** for API Gateway functionality and load balancing.

### **2. System Communication**
- **RESTful APIs**: Services will communicate with each other using REST APIs.
- **gRPC**: If performance and efficiency are crucial for internal communication, consider using gRPC for service-to-service communication.
- **Message Queues**: RabbitMQ/Kafka can be used for handling background tasks and processing large amounts of data asynchronously.

### **3. Scalability and Performance**
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Use Docker and Kubernetes to deploy and scale the services horizontally.
  - **Kubernetes** for orchestrating containers and managing service scaling.
  - **Docker** for containerization of microservices.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Use **FastAPI** for async handling of API requests, particularly in the Product Catalog and Recommendation Engine services.
- **Caching with Redis**: Cache product catalogs and recommendation results to minimize heavy computation and optimize response times.

### **4. Load Balancing & Auto-Scaling**
- **Load Balancer**: Use **NGINX** or **HAProxy** for distributing traffic across multiple instances of services to ensure high availability and distribute load evenly.
- **Auto-Scaling**: Use **Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** for automatic scaling based on traffic and resource usage.

### **5. Security**
- **API Gateway**: For managing traffic, throttling, and securing access to microservices.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting via the API Gateway to avoid service overload from too many simultaneous requests.
- **TLS Encryption**: Ensure that communication between services is encrypted using **TLS** (Transport Layer Security).

### **6. Monitoring and Logging**
- **Prometheus**: For monitoring system metrics like CPU, memory, and request latency.
- **Grafana**: For visualizing metrics and performance dashboards.
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** or **Fluentd**: For centralized logging and tracking API usage and errors across microservices.
- **Distributed Tracing**: Implement tracing (e.g., **Jaeger**, **Zipkin**) for debugging and identifying performance bottlenecks across microservices.

## **Database and Data Management**
- **Database Choices**:
  - **MongoDB** or **Cassandra** for NoSQL data, ideal for product catalogs and other unstructured data.
  - **PostgreSQL** for any structured data (e.g., product metadata, recommendation logs).
  - **Redis** for caching frequently accessed data (recommendations, product details).
  
- **Data Consistency**:
  - Implement eventual consistency if the system requires background processing and asynchronous jobs that don't need to block the request-response cycle.
  - Use **CQRS** (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) if needed to separate read and write workloads efficiently.

---

## **Deployment and DevOps Considerations**
- **Docker**: Containerize all microservices to ensure consistency across environments and ease of deployment.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestrate containers for deployment, scaling, and management of microservices.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Implement automated build and deployment pipelines (using tools like **Jenkins**, **GitLab CI**, or **GitHub Actions**) to ensure rapid development and deployment.

---

## **High-Level Workflow**
1. **User Request**: The user sends a request for product recommendations via the API Gateway.
2. **API Gateway**:
   - Routes the request to the **Recommendation Engine** service (Django).
3. **Recommendation Engine**:
   - Fetches product data from the **Product Catalog** service (FastAPI) and other sources.
   - Uses cached recommendations from **Redis** or calculates new recommendations.
4. **API Gateway**:
   - Aggregates responses and sends the recommendations back to the user.
