## ** Introduction**
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the **Multi-Product Recommendation System** built using a **microservices architecture**. It outlines the key components, design patterns, algorithms, data structures, security plan, and testing strategy to ensure the system meets high scalability and performance requirements while providing accurate product recommendations.

---

## ** System Overview**

### **stem Goals**
- **Public-facing** service for generating product recommendations based on product metadata.
- **High scalability and performance** for handling concurrent requests.
- **Microservices-based architecture** with different frameworks used for different components (Flask, FastAPI, Django).
- **No user login** required, but focus on generating **accurate and timely product recommendations**.

### **y Features**
- **Product Catalog Service** (FastAPI): Exposes APIs for retrieving product data.
- **Recommendation Engine** (Django): Generates personalized product recommendations.
- **User Profile Service** (Flask): Provides public-facing API for generic user preferences.
- **API Gateway**: Routes requests between microservices.
- **Caching**: Redis for caching products and recommendations.

---

## ** User Stories**

### ** User Story: Product Recommendation Request**
- **As a user**, I want to request product recommendations so that I can receive personalized or relevant suggestions without login.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - The system responds with a list of recommended products based on product data.
    - Response time is under 500ms for every request.

### ** User Story: Product Catalog Retrieval**
- **As a user**, I want to retrieve detailed product information such as name, category, and price so that I can view the products in detail.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - The system should return the product data in less than 100ms.
    - Product data is retrieved from the **Product Catalog Service** (FastAPI).

### ** User Story: Cached Recommendations**
- **As a user**, I want to receive recommendations that are cached for frequently requested products to reduce latency.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Frequently requested recommendations should be served from **Redis** cache.
    - Cache expiry time should be configurable (e.g., 5 minutes).

### ** User Story: System Scalability**
- **As a system administrator**, I want the system to handle scaling so that performance is maintained even under high load.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - The system can handle up to 10,000 requests per second with auto-scaling capabilities in place.

## ** Architecture**

### **1. High-Level System Architecture**
The architecture follows a **microservices-based** approach with multiple services working independently but communicating with each other.

#### **y Components**:
1. **API Gateway**:
   - Routes requests to the correct microservices (Product Catalog, Recommendation Engine).
   - Handles **rate-limiting**, **logging**, and **security**.
   
2. **User Profile Service (Flask)**:
   - Stateless API for providing general information about users (e.g., preferences, etc.).
   
3. **Product Catalog Service (FastAPI)**:
   - Provides information on products (e.g., details, pricing, categories).
   
4. **Recommendation Engine (Django)**:
   - Generates personalized or popular product recommendations based on catalog data.
   
5. **Redis** (Caching Layer):
   - Used to cache product data and recommendations for quick retrieval.

6. **Database** (MongoDB, PostgreSQL):
   - MongoDB for unstructured product metadata.
   - PostgreSQL for structured data, such as logs or analytics.

7. **Message Queue** (RabbitMQ/Kafka):
   - Used for processing background tasks like recalculating recommendations or syncing data.

8. **Kubernetes**:
   - Manages microservices scaling, deployment, and orchestration.

---

## ** Design**

### **1. Design Patterns**
- **Microservices**: The system follows a **microservices architecture** to ensure modularity, scalability, and independence.
- **API Gateway Pattern**: The API Gateway pattern is used for routing requests and enforcing cross-cutting concerns like rate-limiting and logging.
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Implemented in the **API Gateway** to prevent cascading failures in case of service unavailability.
- **Caching Pattern**: Redis cache is used to store and quickly retrieve frequently accessed data, improving system performance.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Background tasks are handled using **RabbitMQ** or **Kafka** for processing heavy tasks asynchronously.
- **Repository Pattern**: Used in the **Product Catalog** and **Recommendation Engine** services to abstract data access and enable testing.

## ** Database and Data Storage Flow**

               |       Product Catalog    |
               |         Database          |
               |  (MongoDB or PostgreSQL)  |

                         ^
                         |
           +-------------v-------------+
           |   Recommendation Engine   |
           |       (Django ORM)         |

                  +-------------------+
                  |   User Profile DB |
                  |    (PostgreSQL)   |
                  +-------------------+

```

### Description:
- **Product Catalog Database**: Stores all product data (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL).
- **Recommendation Engine Database**: Stores recommendation-related data, logs, or user activity (e.g., PostgreSQL).
- **User Profile Database**: Stores generic user data, such as preferences (e.g., PostgreSQL).



## ** Algorithms**

### ** Product Recommendation Algorithm**
The recommendation system may implement one or more of the following algorithms:
- **Collaborative Filtering**:
  - Uses user-item interactions (like views, clicks) to recommend products based on the behavior of similar users.
  
- **Content-Based Filtering**:
  - Recommends products based on product metadata (e.g., category, price, description).
  
- **Hybrid Model**:
  - Combines collaborative filtering and content-based methods to improve recommendation quality.

- **Popularity-Based**:
  - For items without enough user interactions, recommend popular products based on overall sales.

### ** Data Structures**
- **Hash Maps**: To store frequently accessed product data in memory (e.g., for caching in Redis).
- **Heaps/Priority Queues**: For ranking products by relevance or popularity.
- **Graphs**: For representing relationships between products (e.g., "frequently bought together").
  
---

## ** Security Plan**

### ** Security Requirements**
- **Authentication**: No user login required, but ensure **API key authentication** for services that need access control.
- **Authorization**: Use role-based access control (RBAC) for internal services.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate-limiting at the API Gateway to prevent DDoS attacks and resource exhaustion.
- **Input Validation**: Validate user inputs to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.
- **Encryption**: Use **TLS/SSL** for secure communication between services.
- **Firewall**: Set up firewalls to restrict access to the internal services and databases.

### ** Security Measures**
- Use **OAuth2** or **API Keys** for internal service-to-service authentication.
- Use **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for managing authentication in case the user login requirement changes.
- **Log Sensitive Data**: Regularly log and monitor for suspicious activity.

---

## ** Test Plan**

### **1. Unit Testing**
- Test individual microservices for functional correctness.
  - Use **pytest** for Python-based services (Flask, FastAPI, Django).
  - Test endpoints, data parsing, error handling, etc.

### **2. Integration Testing**
- Ensure communication between services works as expected.
  - Mock external services during testing.
  - Test data flow between **Product Catalog** and **Recommendation Engine**.

### **3. Load Testing**
- Simulate a high number of requests to ensure the system can scale effectively.
  - Tools: **Apache JMeter**, **Locust**.

### **4. Performance Testing**
- Test response times and resource utilization.
  - Focus on the **Recommendation Engine** and **Product Catalog Service**.

### **5. Security Testing**
- Test for **SQL Injection**, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, and other vulnerabilities.
  - Use **OWASP ZAP** for penetration testing.
