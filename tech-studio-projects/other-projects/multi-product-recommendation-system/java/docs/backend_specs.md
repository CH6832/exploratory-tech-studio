### Explanation

- **api-gateway/**: Handles all external requests and routes them to the appropriate services. This microservice enforces security and rate limiting.
- **product-service/**, **user-service/**, **recommendation-engine-service/**, **analytics-service/**: Separate microservices dedicated to core system functionalities.
- **common-libraries/**: Shared classes and components across services, such as data transfer objects (DTOs), utility classes, and constants.

## 2. Microservice Structure and Technical Specifications

Each service follows a similar project structure but with specific functionalities and dependencies tailored to its role.

### General Microservice Project Structure

Each service follows this general structure within its directory:

```plaintext

├── main/
│   ├── java/
│   │   └── com/
│   │       └── [service-name]/
│   │           ├── controller/           # REST API controllers
│   │           ├── service/              # Core business logic

│   │           ├── model/                # Domain entities
│   │           ├── dto/                  # Data transfer objects
│   │           ├── config/               # Configuration classes
│   │           └── exception/            # Custom exception handling
│   └── resources/
│       ├── application.yml               # Service-specific configurations
│       └── logback-spring.xml            # Logging configurations
└── test/
    └── java/                             # Unit and integration tests

### Detailed Microservices Specifications

#### 2.1 Product Service

- **Purpose**: Manages product-related data, providing details on products, categories, and availability.

#### 2.3 Recommendation Engine Service

- **Purpose**: Generates personalized product recommendations based on user behavior and product attributes.
- **Key Dependencies**: Machine learning library (e.g., TensorFlow), Redis for caching recommendations, gRPC (optional for high-performance communication).
- **Technical Features**:
  - Implement collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models.
  - Trigger model training periodically based on new user data.
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /recommendations/{userId}`: Fetch personalized recommendations.
  - `POST /recommendations/train`: Trigger model training.

#### 2.4 Analytics Service

- **Purpose**: Tracks user interactions (clicks, views, purchases) for reporting and data analytics.
- **Key Dependencies**: Elasticsearch (for efficient analytics), Kafka or RabbitMQ (for logging events asynchronously)
- **Technical Features**:
  - Logging of user interactions.
  - Data aggregation and reporting for insights on user behavior.
  - Integration with Recommendation Engine for enhanced recommendations.
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /analytics/log`: Log a user interaction.
  - `GET /analytics/report`: Generate usage reports.

#### 2.5 API Gateway

- **Purpose**: Centralized entry point for all external requests, routing them to the correct service.
- **Key Dependencies**: Spring Cloud Gateway, Spring Security, OAuth2 (for authentication).
- **Technical Features**:
  - Routes requests to internal services based on URL mappings.
  - Handles rate limiting, authentication, and authorization.
  - Implements logging for all requests and responses.
- **Endpoints**:
  - Acts as a proxy to other services (e.g., `/products/**` routes to Product Service).

## 3. Data Flow and Communication

The backend services use both synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns. RESTful APIs are used for synchronous requests, and a message broker (RabbitMQ/Kafka) is used for asynchronous events, especially when updating recommendations or logging analytics.

1. **Frontend requests** go through the API Gateway.
2. **API Gateway** routes requests to services, enforcing security and throttling.
3. **Product & User Services** provide the Recommendation Engine Service with data via API calls.
4. **Recommendation Engine Service** periodically trains models and updates recommendations.
5. **Analytics Service** collects user data and sends periodic updates to Recommendation Engine.

### API Gateway and Microservices Communication

```plaintext
Client (Angular) ----> API Gateway ----> Product Service
                                    |
                                    +--> User Service
                                    |
                                    +--> Recommendation Engine
                                    |
                                    +--> Analytics Service
```

## Additional Technical Specifications

- **Error Handling**: Each service should implement custom exceptions and global exception handling (using `@ControllerAdvice` in Spring Boot).
- **Circuit Breaker**: Integrate Hystrix or Resilience4j in each service to handle downstream failures.
- **Security**: Use JWTs for securing endpoints via API Gateway, with role-based access control enforced on each service.
