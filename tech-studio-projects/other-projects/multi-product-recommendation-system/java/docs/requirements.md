## 1. Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a multi-product recommendation system using a microservice architecture to support scalability and maintainability. The backend will be built using Java and Spring Boot, while the frontend will be an Angular single-page application (SPA). The system will provide personalized product recommendations for users, leveraging both rule-based algorithms and machine learning models.

## 2. System Objectives

1. **Personalized Recommendations**: Deliver relevant product suggestions to users based on their behavior, preferences, and product data.
2. **Scalability**: Utilize a microservice architecture to allow for scaling of individual services based on demand.
3. **Real-Time and Batch Recommendations**: Provide recommendations in real-time (based on user interactions) and through batch processes (e.g., nightly processing).
4. **Security and Compliance**: Ensure data security and adhere to industry-standard data protection practices.
5. **Extendability**: Allow for easy integration of new recommendation algorithms and machine learning models.

## 3. High-Level Architecture

The system architecture comprises several independent microservices, each handling a specific functionality. These services will communicate via RESTful APIs, with an API Gateway managing external client requests. The architecture will be containerized using Docker, and Kubernetes will be used for orchestration and scaling.

## 4. Microservices Overview

### 4.1 Product Service

**Description**: Manages product-related data, including details, categories, prices, and availability.

- **Features**:
  - CRUD operations for products and categories.
  - Endpoint for retrieving product details for recommendation logic.
  - Data caching for frequently accessed product data (e.g., Redis).
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /products/{id}`: Fetches details of a specific product.
  - `POST /products`: Adds a new product.
  - `PUT /products/{id}`: Updates a product.
  - `DELETE /products/{id}`: Deletes a product.
- **Database**: SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL) for structured data storage.

### 4.2 User Service

**Description**: Manages user-related information, such as profiles, preferences, and interaction history.

- **Features**:
  - CRUD operations for user profiles.
  - Track and store user purchase history and interaction data.
  - Store user preferences for personalized recommendations.
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /users/{id}`: Fetches user profile.
  - `POST /users`: Creates a new user profile.
  - `PUT /users/{id}`: Updates user information.
  - `DELETE /users/{id}`: Deletes a user.
- **Database**: SQL for user information, NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) for interaction history.

### 4.3 Recommendation Engine Service

**Description**: Generates product recommendations for users using a combination of algorithms.

- **Features**:
  - Implements collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models.
  - Supports machine learning-based recommendation models.
  - Periodic batch processing for updating recommendations.
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /recommendations/{userId}`: Fetches product recommendations for a specific user.
  - `POST /recommendations/train`: Triggers model training (for ML-based recommendations).
- **Database**: NoSQL for storing recommendation outputs and model data (e.g., Cassandra or Redis).

### 4.4 Analytics Service

**Description**: Tracks user interactions (clicks, views, purchases) for analytics and recommendation improvements.

- **Features**:
  - Logs user actions, such as product views and purchases.
  - Aggregates data for analytics and reporting.
  - Feeds interaction data into the recommendation engine.
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /analytics/log`: Logs user interactions.
  - `GET /analytics/report`: Fetches analytics reports.
- **Database**: NoSQL (e.g., Elasticsearch) for fast analytics processing.

### 4.5 API Gateway

**Description**: Manages incoming API requests, routing them to the appropriate microservices and ensuring secure access.

- **Features**:
  - Authentication and authorization checks.
  - Request routing to appropriate services.
  - Rate limiting and logging.
- **Endpoints**:
  - Acts as a proxy to the internal service endpoints.

## 5. Frontend Requirements (Angular)

**Description**: The Angular frontend will display recommended products, manage user interactions, and provide an intuitive user experience.

- **Features**:
  - **User Authentication**: Enable user login and registration.
  - **Product Display**: Show products and recommended items based on user preferences.
  - **Interactive UI**: Display recommendations in various formats (e.g., carousel, grid).
  - **Real-Time Updates**: Display updated recommendations as user actions are logged.
- **State Management**: Use services or NgRx for managing application state.

## 6. Data Storage Requirements

- **Product Data**: SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for structured product information.
- **User Data**: SQL for core user data, NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) for interaction history.
- **Recommendations**: NoSQL (e.g., Redis or Cassandra) for storing recommendations and caching.
- **Analytics**: Elasticsearch for user interaction data and analytics.

## 7. Recommendation Algorithms and Machine Learning

**Description**: This system will use multiple recommendation techniques.

- **Algorithms**:
  - Collaborative Filtering: Based on similar user interactions.
  - Content-Based Filtering: Based on product attributes.
  - Hybrid Model: Combines multiple approaches.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Integration of ML models (e.g., TensorFlow or Apache Mahout).
  - Regular model retraining to adapt to new data.

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability**: Each microservice should be horizontally scalable.
- **Performance**: Recommendations should be generated in under 200ms for real-time requests.
- **Reliability**: Ensure a 99.9% uptime for critical services.
- **Usability**: The Angular UI must provide a responsive and user-friendly experience.

## 9. Security and Compliance

- **Authentication**: Use OAuth 2.0 or JWT for user authentication.
- **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for secure API access.
- **Data Protection**: Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to GDPR for user data storage and processing.

## 10. Deployment and Scalability

- **Containerization**: Use Docker to containerize each microservice.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for automated deployment, scaling, and management.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.

## 11. API Documentation

- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Generate interactive API documentation for each microservice.
- **Endpoint Descriptions**: Document request/response structures, error codes, and examples.

## 12. Testing Requirements

- **Unit Testing**: Cover core logic for each service.
- **Integration Testing**: Validate communication between services.
- **Load Testing**: Test each service under heavy loads to ensure scalability.
- **Security Testing**: Identify vulnerabilities with penetration testing tools.
