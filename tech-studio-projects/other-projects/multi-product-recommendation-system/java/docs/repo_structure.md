### Frontend Directory (`frontend/`)

- **angular.json**: Configures the Angular CLI.
- **src/app/core/**: Contains essential services like `AuthService`, interceptors for HTTP requests, and models for data structures.
- **src/app/shared/**: Holds reusable components, directives, and pipes (e.g., UI components like buttons, filters, and common utility pipes).
- **src/app/features/**: Modularized feature directories for different functionalities, each containing components, services, and sub-modules.
  - **products/**: Components for product browsing and detail views.
  - **recommendations/**: Components for displaying personalized product recommendations.
  - **user-profile/**: Components for managing user profiles and preferences.
  - **analytics/**: Components for viewing user interactions and analytics data.
- **src/app/state/**: Manages application state using NgRx, with actions, reducers, and effects for each feature.
- **src/app/app-routing.module.ts**: Sets up lazy-loaded routes to improve application performance.
- **src/assets/**: Contains static assets, including images, icons, and other resources.
- **environments/**: Contains environment-specific configurations, typically for development, testing, and production.
- **Dockerfile**: Used to containerize the Angular application for deployment.

### Backend Directory (`backend/`)

#### 1. API Gateway (`api-gateway/`)

- **Purpose**: Serves as the single entry point for all external requests and routes them to the appropriate backend microservices.
- **Main Components**:
  - **src/**: Contains the source code for routing, request logging, and security.
  - **Dockerfile**: Builds the API Gateway image for containerization.
  - **build.gradle**: Configures dependencies and build options.

#### 2. Product Service (`product-service/`)

- **Purpose**: Manages product-related data and provides an API for product information, categories, and filtering options.
- **Main Components**:
  - **src/**: Holds components for data models, service layer, and REST controllers.
  - **Dockerfile** and **build.gradle**: Configuration for building and deploying the service.

#### 3. Recommendation Engine Service (`recommendation-service/`)

- **Purpose**: Provides recommendations based on user preferences and product attributes.
- **Main Components**:
  - **src/**: Implements recommendation algorithms, either machine learning-based or heuristic.
  - **Dockerfile** and **build.gradle**: Configuration for building and deploying the recommendation engine.

#### 4. User Service (`user-service/`)

- **Purpose**: Manages user profiles, purchase history, and preferences.
- **Main Components**:
  - **src/**: Contains user authentication, CRUD operations for user profiles, and interaction history.
  - **Dockerfile** and **build.gradle**: Configuration for building and deploying the service.

#### 5. Analytics Service (`analytics-service/`)

- **Purpose**: Logs user interactions, gathers data on product clicks, purchases, and views, and generates reports.

  - **src/**: Contains server setup to retrieve and serve configuration data to other services.
  - **Dockerfile** and **build.gradle**: Configuration for building and deploying the Config Server.

#### 7. Common Libraries (`common-libraries/`)

- **Purpose**: Houses shared components, such as data transfer objects (DTOs), constants, and utility classes used by multiple services.
- **Structure**:
  - **src/**: Contains shared code, organized by component type (e.g., `dto/`, `utils/`, `constants/`).
  - **build.gradle**: Configuration for building shared libraries.

#### 8. Documentation (`documentation/`)

- **Purpose**: Centralized documentation for API endpoints, architectural design, and system diagrams.
- **Contents**:
  - **api-docs.md**: API specifications for each endpoint across microservices.
  - **architecture.md**: Detailed explanation of the system architecture, data flow, and technical decisions.
  - **microservices-diagram.png**: Visual depiction of the microservice relationships and interactions.

### Scripts Directory (`scripts/`)

- **Purpose**: Contains utility scripts for setting up the environment, deploying to production, and running tests across all services.
- **Files**:
  - **deploy.sh**: Script to deploy the full project stack to a production environment.

### Project Workflow Overview

1. **API Gateway** acts as the main entry point, enforcing security

, managing request routing, and handling load balancing.
2. **Frontend (Angular)**: User interface for the application, allowing users to interact with products, recommendations, and their profile.
3. **Backend Microservices**:
   - **Product Service** provides product data.
   - **Recommendation Service** delivers personalized product recommendations.
   - **User Service** manages user data and authentication.
   - **Analytics Service** collects and processes data on user interactions.
4. **Config Server**: Central configuration for all services, enabling consistent and environment-specific configurations.
