#### **Project Requirements**

This file outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the project.

**Functional Requirements:**
1. **Echo Command:**
   - The server should receive a message from the client, process it, and send the same message back.
   
2. **File Transfer:**
   - The server should accept file uploads from clients and store them in a designated directory.

3. **Client Interaction:**
   - The client should be able to communicate with the server using simple commands.
   - The client can send text messages (echo) or files.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - The server should return appropriate error messages if the file does not exist or if there is an issue during file transfer.
   - The server should handle invalid commands gracefully.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
1. **Scalability:**
   - The system should be able to handle multiple client requests concurrently.
   
2. **Security:**
   - Only authorized users should be able to upload files.
   - File uploads should be validated to prevent malicious content.

3. **Performance:**
   - The system should handle multiple requests without significant delays.
