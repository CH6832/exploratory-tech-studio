# Testing Strategy for Contract Management System

## Overview

The goal of the **Testing Strategy** is to ensure the quality, reliability, and stability of the Contract Management System by applying a robust testing process at various stages of development. This document outlines the types of testing that will be used to validate the functionality, performance, and security of the system.

Testing will be done at multiple levels: **Unit Testing**, **Integration Testing**, **End-to-End Testing**, **Performance Testing**, and **Security Testing**.

## Types of Testing

### 1. **Unit Testing**

Unit tests are essential for testing the individual components or methods of the system. These tests verify that each unit of the code behaves as expected in isolation.

#### Objectives:
- Test individual methods, classes, and small components.
- Ensure that each part of the application is functioning correctly and in isolation.
- Achieve fast feedback during development.

#### Frameworks and Tools:
- **JUnit**: A widely-used testing framework for Java applications, to write unit tests.
- **Mockito**: For mocking external dependencies and objects in unit tests.
- **AssertJ**: For fluent assertions in unit tests, providing better readability.

#### Example:
```java
@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)
public class ContractServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private ContractRepository contractRepository;

    @InjectMocks
    private ContractService contractService;

    @Test
    public void testCreateContract() {
        Contract contract = new Contract("Contract A", "Company X", "Company Y", LocalDate.now(), LocalDate.now().plusYears(1));
        when(contractRepository.save(any(Contract.class))).thenReturn(contract);

        Contract createdContract = contractService.createContract(contract);
        
        assertNotNull(createdContract);
        assertEquals("Contract A", createdContract.getTitle());
    }
}
```

### 2. **Integration Testing**

Integration tests verify the interaction between different components and services. These tests are used to check if multiple parts of the system work together as expected.

#### Objectives:
- Ensure that different modules of the system (e.g., Contract Service, Notification Service, Database) interact correctly.
- Verify data flow between the services, databases, and other components.
- Test API endpoints to ensure that data is correctly transmitted across service boundaries.

#### Frameworks and Tools:
- **Spring Boot Test**: For setting up integration tests with Spring Boot.
- **Testcontainers**: For spinning up actual instances of services like MongoDB in Docker containers to simulate integration with databases.
- **RestAssured**: For testing RESTful APIs, sending requests, and validating responses.
- **WireMock**: For mocking external services or APIs during testing.

#### Example:
```java
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
public class ContractControllerIntegrationTest {

    @Autowired
    private MockMvc mockMvc;

    @Test
    public void testCreateContract() throws Exception {
        String contractJson = "{ \"title\": \"Contract A\", \"partyA\": \"Company X\", \"partyB\": \"Company Y\", \"startDate\": \"2024-01-01\", \"endDate\": \"2025-01-01\", \"status\": \"draft\" }";

        mockMvc.perform(post("/contracts")
                .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
                .content(contractJson))
                .andExpect(status().isCreated())
                .andExpect(jsonPath("$.title").value("Contract A"));
    }
}
```

### 3. **End-to-End Testing**

End-to-end (E2E) tests ensure that the system works as a whole. These tests simulate real user interactions with the system and check if all components function together as expected.

#### Objectives:
- Test the entire system from start to finish (including the front-end and back-end).
- Validate business workflows, such as contract creation, updates, and notifications.
- Ensure that the system behaves correctly from a user’s perspective.

#### Frameworks and Tools:
- **Cucumber**: For writing Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) style scenarios and tests.
- **Selenium**: For automating browser-based end-to-end testing, especially for testing web interfaces.
- **TestCafe**: An alternative to Selenium for front-end testing.

#### Example:
```gherkin
Feature: Create and View Contract

  Scenario: A user creates a new contract
    Given I am logged in as a user
    When I create a new contract with the title "Contract A"
    Then I should see the contract with the title "Contract A" on my dashboard
```

### 4. **Performance Testing**

Performance testing ensures that the system can handle the expected load and scale effectively. This type of testing will verify the system's response times, resource usage, and capacity.

#### Objectives:
- Ensure the system can handle a large number of contracts being created, updated, and retrieved.
- Check for system performance under heavy load and ensure it meets required service-level agreements (SLAs).
- Identify and resolve performance bottlenecks, especially in database queries, API responses, and background processing.

#### Frameworks and Tools:
- **JMeter**: For load testing, simulating many users making requests to the system.
- **Gatling**: Another load testing tool that can be used for testing the performance of REST APIs.
- **Spring Boot Actuator**: For monitoring the application’s performance, resource usage, and health during testing.

#### Example:
1. Using **JMeter** for load testing your contract creation API by sending multiple requests and measuring response times, throughput, and error rates.
2. Using **Grafana** for visualizing metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, and request latency.

### 5. **Security Testing**

Security testing ensures that the system is protected against common vulnerabilities and attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and unauthorized access.

#### Objectives:
- Ensure user data and sensitive information are protected.
- Validate that the system’s authentication and authorization mechanisms are functioning properly.
- Check for common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.

#### Frameworks and Tools:
- **OWASP ZAP**: An automated penetration testing tool to find security vulnerabilities.
- **Postman**: For testing the security of APIs, ensuring proper authorization and access control.
- **SonarQube**: For static code analysis to catch security flaws, code smells, and bugs.

#### Example:
1. Using **OWASP ZAP** to scan your APIs and look for vulnerabilities.
2. Testing JWT token expiration and ensuring it’s being properly handled across the system.

## Testing Pipeline

### Continuous Integration (CI)
- Unit and integration tests are run automatically with every commit to the repository.
- The **CI Pipeline** (using Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions) will build the project, run all tests, and provide feedback to the development team.
- The tests should be categorized as:
  - **Unit tests**: Quick feedback loop, run every time code is pushed.
  - **Integration tests**: Run when code is merged into the main branch, to test interactions between components.
  - **End-to-end tests**: Run on staging or pre-production environments to validate full workflows.

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
- The system should deploy only if all tests pass, and performance benchmarks are met.
- After deployment, a set of smoke tests (basic functional tests) will be run in the production environment to ensure critical services are up and running.

## Test Coverage

- The target for **unit test coverage** is **90%+**, ensuring that critical business logic is covered by tests.
- **Integration tests** should cover key business processes like creating, updating, and deleting contracts.
- **End-to-end tests** should cover the most common user workflows and edge cases.

---

## Conclusion

By implementing a comprehensive **testing strategy**, we can ensure that the Contract Management System is robust, reliable, and performs well under various conditions. Regular and automated testing will help catch bugs early, improve code quality, and provide confidence that the system will behave as expected in production. 

This strategy will help ensure that all system components function correctly, both in isolation and when integrated, and will provide sufficient coverage to safeguard the system’s performance and security.
