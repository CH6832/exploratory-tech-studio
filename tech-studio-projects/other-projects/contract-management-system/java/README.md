### Project: Blockchain-Based Contract Management Platform using Spring, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud

**Description:**
The project is a blockchain-powered contract management platform designed to securely manage contracts, change orders, and payments between stakeholders in construction projects. Leveraging Spring, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud for microservices architecture, it integrates blockchain technology to ensure data integrity and transparency, enabling a robust and secure platform for contract management.

### **Key Features:**

#### 1. **Smart Contracts**
   **Objective:**
   Automate contract execution, payment release, and validation based on predefined milestones.

   **Implementation:**
   - **Blockchain Integration**: Deploy smart contracts on a blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Hyperledger) for automated enforcement of terms.
   - **Smart Contract API**: Spring Boot microservices expose REST APIs for creating, deploying, and interacting with smart contracts. Milestones and payment triggers are pre-configured in the contract.
   - **Event Listeners**: Use Spring listeners to monitor smart contract events (e.g., milestone completion) and trigger payment release or contract updates.

#### 2. **Immutable Ledger**
   **Objective:**
   Maintain a secure, immutable record of all contract changes, approvals, and payments for auditability and transparency.

   **Implementation:**
   - **Blockchain Ledger**: Store each contract interaction (modification, approval, payment) as a blockchain transaction, ensuring immutability.
   - **Transaction Service**: Use Spring Data with a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for fast querying and blockchain for secure historical data storage.
   - **Blockchain-Linked Hashing**: Each record in the database is linked to a blockchain transaction hash to provide a verifiable, tamper-proof audit trail.
   - **Spring Cloud Streams**: Handle communication between services with Kafka/RabbitMQ for blockchain event processing.

#### 3. **Stakeholder Access**
   **Objective:**
   Provide secure, role-based access for stakeholders such as contractors, suppliers, and clients to view and approve contract terms and changes.

   **Implementation:**
   - **OAuth2/JWT Security**: Use **Spring Security** with OAuth2 and JWT tokens to authenticate and authorize users based on roles.
   - **Role-Based Access Control**: Define granular access permissions for stakeholders. For instance, contractors can propose changes, suppliers can update costs, and clients can approve.
   - **Angular Front-End**: A front-end (or mobile app) built in Angular allows stakeholders to log in, view contracts, and approve changes through the exposed REST APIs.
   - **Secure Contract Management API**: APIs are provided for stakeholders to view contract status, upload documents, and approve changes.

#### 4. **Cost & Time Tracking**
   **Objective:**
   Automatically track project costs, time spent, and compare them with contract conditions to detect overages or delays.

   **Implementation:**
   - **Tracking Microservices**: Use Spring Boot microservices to handle cost tracking and time logging, with data stored in a distributed database (e.g., MongoDB).
   - **Integration with Smart Contracts**: Update the blockchain ledger with real-time cost and time data. Smart contracts trigger notifications when certain thresholds are reached (e.g., costs exceed agreed amounts).
   - **Spring Cloud Sleuth**: Use Sleuth and Zipkin for distributed tracing, ensuring that cost and time-tracking events are consistently logged across microservices.
   - **Cost Reporting Dashboard**: Real-time dashboards displaying the current project status, cost overruns, and time spent using Spring Data and Spring MVC.

#### 5. **Audit Trails**
   **Objective:**
   Generate detailed audit trails for all contract-related activities to ensure legal compliance and provide a full history of the contract lifecycle.

   **Implementation:**
   - **Immutable Log Service**: A microservice built using **Spring Boot** logs all changes to contracts and payments, storing them immutably on both the blockchain and the database.
   - **Audit API**: Provide REST APIs to retrieve a full history of a contract, including who made changes, approvals, and any payments.
   - **Compliance Reports**: Generate downloadable audit reports (PDF/Excel) that include all contract events for compliance purposes, integrated into the admin dashboard.
   - **Spring Boot Scheduler**: A scheduled job that automatically generates audit reports for regulatory bodies and stores them securely.

#### 6. **Search Service**
   **Objective:**
   Enable efficient searching of contracts by title and description.

   **Implementation:**
   - **Elasticsearch Integration**: Utilize Elasticsearch for indexing contracts and providing fast search capabilities.
   - **Search API**: Expose REST APIs for searching contracts, which leverage Elasticsearch's powerful querying capabilities.
   - **Microservices Architecture**: The Search Service operates independently within the microservices ecosystem, facilitating loose coupling and easier scalability.

### **System Architecture:**

1. **Microservices**: 
   - A set of Spring Boot microservices managing different aspects of contract management, blockchain interaction, cost tracking, and audit logging.
   - Microservices communicate via **Spring Cloud** and share data through APIs.
  
2. **Blockchain Layer**:
   - Smart contracts reside on a blockchain (Ethereum or Hyperledger). All contract events (changes, payments, approvals) are stored in an immutable ledger.
   
3. **API Gateway**:
   - Use **Spring Cloud Gateway** to expose services securely to external users (stakeholders). It handles rate limiting, security, and service routing.

4. **Stakeholder Access Portal**:
   - An Angular-based portal allowing different users (contractors, suppliers, clients) to access contracts securely, submit updates, and track milestones.

5. **Event Processing**:
   - **Kafka/RabbitMQ** handles blockchain events (e.g., payment milestones reached), allowing the microservices to react and trigger additional actions like notifications or approvals.
