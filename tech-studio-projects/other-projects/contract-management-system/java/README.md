### Project: Contract Management Platform using Spring and Spring Boot

**Description:**

The project is a contract management platform designed to securely manage contracts, change orders, and payments between stakeholders in construction projects. Built using Spring and Spring Boot for a microservices architecture, the platform ensures data integrity and transparency, providing a robust and secure system for contract management.

### **Key Features:**

#### 1. **Contract Automation**

   Automate contract execution, payment release, and validation based on predefined milestones.

   **Implementation:**
   
   - **Smart Contract API**: Spring Boot microservices expose REST APIs for creating, managing, and interacting with contracts. Milestones and payment triggers are pre-configured in the contract.
   
   - **Event Listeners**: Spring listeners to monitor contract events (e.g., milestone completion) and trigger payment release or contract updates.

#### 2. **Secure Record Keeping**

   Maintain a secure, tamper-proof record of all contract changes, approvals, and payments for auditability and transparency.

   **Implementation:**
   
   - **Transaction Service**: Spring Data with a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for fast querying and storage of contract interactions (modifications, approvals, payments).
   
   - **Database-Linked Hashing**: Each record in the database is linked to a verifiable hash to provide a secure audit trail.
   
   - **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ for communication between services for event processing.

#### 3. **Stakeholder Access**

   Provide secure, role-based access for stakeholders such as contractors, suppliers, and clients to view and approve contract terms and changes.

   **Implementation:**
   
   - **OAuth2/JWT Security**: Spring Security with OAuth2 and JWT tokens to authenticate and authorize users based on roles.
   
   - **Role-Based Access Control**: Define granular access permissions for stakeholders. For instance, contractors can propose changes, suppliers can update costs, and clients can approve.
   
   - **Angular Front-End**: A front-end (or mobile app) built in Angular allows stakeholders to log in, view contracts, and approve changes through the exposed REST APIs.
   
   - **Secure Contract Management API**: APIs are provided for stakeholders to view contract status, upload documents, and approve changes.

#### 4. **Cost & Time Tracking**

   Automatically track project costs, time spent, and compare them with contract conditions to detect overages or delays.

   **Implementation:**
   
   - **Tracking Microservices**: Spring Boot microservices to handle cost tracking and time logging, with data stored in a distributed database (e.g., MongoDB).
   
   - **Threshold Notifications**: Trigger notifications when certain thresholds are reached (e.g., costs exceed agreed amounts).
   
   - **Distributed Tracing**: Spring Sleuth and Zipkin for distributed tracing to ensure that cost and time-tracking events are consistently logged across microservices.
   
   - **Cost Reporting Dashboard**: Real-time dashboards displaying the current project status, cost overruns, and time spent using Spring Data and Spring MVC.

#### 5. **Audit Trails**

   Generate detailed audit trails for all contract-related activities to ensure legal compliance and provide a full history of the contract lifecycle.

   **Implementation:**
   
   - **Log Service**: A microservice built using Spring Boot logs all changes to contracts and payments, storing them immutably in the database.
   
   - **Audit API**: Provide REST APIs to retrieve a full history of a contract, including who made changes, approvals, and any payments.
   
   - **Compliance Reports**: Generate downloadable audit reports (PDF/Excel) that include all contract events for compliance purposes, integrated into the admin dashboard.
   
   - **Spring Boot Scheduler**: A scheduled job that automatically generates audit reports for regulatory bodies and stores them securely.

#### 6. **Search Service**

   Enable efficient searching of contracts by title and description.

   **Implementation:**
   
   - **Elasticsearch Integration**: Utilize Elasticsearch for indexing contracts and providing fast search capabilities.
   
   - **Search API**: Expose REST APIs for searching contracts, which leverage Elasticsearch's powerful querying capabilities.
   
   - **Microservices Architecture**: The Search Service operates independently within the microservices ecosystem, facilitating loose coupling and easier scalability.

### **System Architecture:**

   **Microservices**:
   
   - A set of Spring Boot microservices managing different aspects of contract management, cost tracking, and audit logging.
   
   - Microservices communicate via REST APIs and use message brokers (Kafka/RabbitMQ) for event-driven communication.

   **API Gateway**:

   - Spring Boot API Gateway to expose services securely to external users (stakeholders). It handles rate limiting, security, and service routing.

   **Event Processing**:

   - RabbitMQ handles events (e.g., payment milestones reached), allowing the microservices to react and trigger additional actions like notifications or approvals.
