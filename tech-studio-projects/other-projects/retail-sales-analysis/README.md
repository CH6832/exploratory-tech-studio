## **Data Model**

The project uses a **Star Schema** design with one fact table and four dimension tables:

### **Fact Table**
- **Sales Data**
  - `SalesID` (Primary Key)
  - `Date`
  - `CustomerID`
  - `EmployeeID`
  - `ProductID`
  - `InventoryID`
  - `SalesAmount`
  - `QuantitySold`

### **Dimension Tables**
- **Customer Data**
  - `CustomerID` (Primary Key)
  - `CustomerName`
  - `CustomerAddress`
  - `CustomerEmail`
  - `CustomerSegment`

- **Employee Data**
  - `EmployeeID` (Primary Key)
  - `EmployeeName`
  - `EmployeeRole`
  - `EmployeeDepartment`

- **Inventory**
  - `InventoryID` (Primary Key)
  - `Location`
  - `InventoryStatus`

- **Products**
  - `ProductID` (Primary Key)
  - `ProductName`
  - `ProductCategory`
  - `ProductPrice`

### **Relationships**
- **Sales Data** -> **Customer Data**: `CustomerID`
- **Sales Data** -> **Employee Data**: `EmployeeID`
- **Sales Data** -> **Products**: `ProductID`
- **Sales Data** -> **Inventory**: `InventoryID`

## **Data Sources**

The data for this project is assumed to be loaded into Power BI from various sources like CSV files, databases, or other systems. The tables mentioned above represent typical retail data:

- **Customer Data**: Customer information such as IDs, names, and contact details.
- **Employee Data**: Details about employees handling sales.
- **Inventory**: Information on product inventory and its status.
- **Products**: Data related to products sold by the business.
- **Sales Data**: Transactional data containing sales records.

## **Dashboard Features**

The dashboard includes the following key visualizations and features:

1. **Total Sales by Product Category**: Visualizes the total sales amount segmented by product category.
2. **Sales by Employee**: Shows sales performance by each employee.
3. **Sales by Customer**: Displays sales amounts attributed to individual customers.
4. **Slicers**: Filters for date, product category, employee, and customer segment to enable dynamic data analysis.
5. **Interactive Elements**: All visuals are interconnected, allowing users to filter and drill down into data.

## **Installation and Setup**

### **Prerequisites**
- Microsoft Power BI Desktop installed.
- Access to data sources (e.g., CSV files, database connections).
  
### **Steps to Set Up**
1. **Clone or Download the Project Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-performance-analysis-dashboard.git
   ```
   Or download the ZIP file from the repository and extract it.

2. **Open the Power BI Report**:
   - Open Power BI Desktop.
   - Navigate to the folder where you saved the project and open the `.pbix` file.

3. **Load Data**:
   - Ensure your data sources are correctly connected.
   - Load the data into Power BI by clicking on "Refresh" in the "Home" tab.

4. **Validate Relationships**:
   - Check the relationships in the Model view to ensure all tables are correctly linked.

5. **Publish the Report**:
   - Once your report is ready, publish it to the Power BI Service to share with others.

## **How to Use the Dashboard**

1. **Navigate the Dashboard**:
   - Explore different visualizations to get insights into sales performance.
   - Use slicers to filter data by date, product category, employee, or customer.

2. **Analyze Sales Performance**:
   - View overall sales trends and drill down into specific categories or employees.
   - Identify top-performing products, employees, or customers.

3. **Export Reports**:
   - Export data or visuals for presentations or further analysis using the "Export" feature in Power BI.

## **Customizing the Dashboard**

### **Adding New Data**
- You can add new data sources by clicking on "Get Data" and importing additional tables.
- Update relationships and visuals accordingly to incorporate new data.

### **Modifying Visuals**
- To modify existing visuals, select the visual on the canvas and use the visualization pane to change chart types, colors, or data fields.

### **Creating New Measures**
- Create new DAX measures by clicking on the "New Measure" button in the "Modeling" tab.

## **Best Practices**

- **Data Quality**: Ensure your data is clean and well-structured before loading it into Power BI.
- **Performance Optimization**: Use Power BI’s performance analyzer to optimize report performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.
- **Documentation**: Keep your Power BI report well-documented, including naming conventions for tables, fields, and measures.

## **Troubleshooting**

- **Data Refresh Issues**: Ensure your data source paths are correct and that you have access to those sources.
- **Performance Lags**: Consider reducing the data load by aggregating data or using Power BI’s query folding capabilities.
- **Incorrect Relationships**: Double-check that all relationships between tables are correctly set up in the model view.
