# Disjoint Set

## Description

A data structure that stores non overlapping or disjoint subset of elements is called disjoint set data structure. The disjoint set data structure supports following operations:

* Adding new sets to the disjoint set.
* Merging disjoint sets to a single disjoint set using Union operation.
* Finding representative of a disjoint set using Find operation.
* Check if two sets are disjoint or not. 

Consider a situation with a number of persons and the following tasks to be performed on them:

* Add a new friendship relation, i.e. a person x becomes the friend of another person y i.e adding new element to a set.
* Find whether individual x is a friend of individual y (direct or indirect friend) [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-disjoint-set-data-structure-or-union-find-algorithm/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-disjoint-set-data-structure-or-union-find-algorithm/)
