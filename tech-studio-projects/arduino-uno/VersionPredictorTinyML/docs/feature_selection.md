# Feature Selection

## Overview

Feature selection is a critical step in the machine learning pipeline where the most relevant features are identified and chosen to improve model performance. In this project, the primary features under consideration are `major` and `minor` version numbers. These features are used to predict the next version in the sequence. This document provides a detailed explanation of the features selected, the rationale behind their selection, and the impact on model training.

## Selected Features

### 1. **Major Version Number (`major`)**

**Description:**
- Represents the major version of the software. Major version increments generally indicate significant updates or changes in functionality.

**Role in Prediction:**
- This feature captures the large-scale changes and trends in versioning. Changes in the major version number can affect the pattern of subsequent version predictions and provide a broader context for forecasting.

**Characteristics:**
- Discrete numeric value.
- Typically increases less frequently compared to the minor version.
- Example values: `1`, `2`, `3`, etc.

**Considerations:**
- Ensure that the major version numbers are within a reasonable range and follow a logical sequence.

### 2. **Minor Version Number (`minor`)**

**Description:**
- Represents the minor version of the software. Minor version increments usually denote smaller updates, fixes, or improvements.

**Role in Prediction:**
- This feature provides finer granularity to the prediction model. It captures incremental changes and updates that can influence the next minor version prediction within the major version context.

**Characteristics:**
- Discrete numeric value.
- Changes more frequently compared to the major version.
- Example values: `0`, `1`, `2`, etc.

**Considerations:**
- Verify that the minor version numbers are consistent and logically incremented within each major version.

## Rationale for Feature Selection

### Direct Representation of Versioning Scheme

**Explanation:**
- The `major` and `minor` version numbers directly represent the versioning scheme used in the software. Since the objective of this project is to predict the next version number in the sequence, these features inherently capture the patterns and trends required for accurate predictions.

**Benefits:**
- **Relevance:** Both features are directly related to the versioning sequence, making them highly relevant for the prediction task.
- **Simplicity:** Using only these features simplifies the model and avoids potential noise from irrelevant data.
- **Predictive Power:** Combining `major` and `minor` version numbers provides a comprehensive view of the versioning scheme, which can improve the model’s ability to predict future versions.

### Impact on Model Performance

**Expected Impact:**
- **Accuracy:** The chosen features are expected to lead to accurate predictions since they directly influence the version sequence.
- **Training Efficiency:** Focusing on these core features reduces the complexity of the model, potentially speeding up training and reducing the risk of overfitting.
- **Interpretability:** The straightforward nature of these features makes the model’s predictions easier to interpret and understand.

### Validation and Testing

**Verification:**
- **Feature Analysis:** Analyze the distribution and range of `major` and `minor` version numbers to ensure they are suitable for prediction.
- **Correlation Study:** Examine the correlation between these features and the target variable (next version) to validate their effectiveness in capturing the underlying patterns.
- **Model Performance:** Test the model’s performance with these features and assess accuracy, precision, and other relevant metrics to confirm that the feature selection is appropriate.

## Summary

Feature selection for this project focuses on the `major` and `minor` version numbers as they directly reflect the software versioning scheme. This choice is motivated by their direct relevance to the prediction task, simplicity, and expected impact on model performance. By using these features, the model is well-positioned to predict the next version number accurately.

Key steps in feature selection include:

1. **Feature Description:** Understanding the role and characteristics of `major` and `minor` version numbers.
2. **Rationale:** Justifying the selection of these features based on their direct representation of the versioning scheme.
3. **Impact:** Evaluating how these features influence model accuracy and performance.
4. **Validation:** Verifying the effectiveness of these features through analysis and testing.
