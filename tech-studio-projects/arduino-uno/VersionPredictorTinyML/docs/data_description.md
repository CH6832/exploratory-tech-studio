# Data Description

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive description of the features in the dataset used for predicting software version increments. Understanding each feature is crucial for effective data preprocessing, modeling, and interpretation of results. This dataset consists of historical version numbers, which will be used to train and evaluate a predictive model for forecasting future software versions.

## Features

The dataset comprises two primary features:

### 1. **major**

- **Description:** 
  - Represents the major version number of the software. This number is used to indicate significant updates or new releases in the software lifecycle. It typically changes when there are substantial changes or improvements to the software that may be backward-incompatible or introduce new features.
  
- **Data Type:** 
  - Integer

- **Example Values:**
  - `1`: Represents the first major version of the software.
  - `2`: Indicates a significant update or second major version.
  - `3`: Denotes the third major release with possibly more extensive changes or new functionalities.

- **Usage:**
  - The major version is crucial for understanding the evolution of the software over time. It helps in categorizing the extent of changes between versions. For example, transitioning from version `1.x.x` to `2.x.x` usually signifies a major overhaul.

- **Typical Values:**
  - Values might start from `0` or `1` and increment by `1` with each major release.

- **Possible Constraints:**
  - Major version numbers should be positive integers.
  - Ensure consistency in the versioning scheme (e.g., avoiding jumps like `1.0` to `5.0` without intermediate versions).

### 2. **minor**

- **Description:** 
  - Represents the minor version number of the software. This number indicates incremental changes, bug fixes, or minor enhancements that are backward-compatible. It is updated with each release that adds minor features or fixes issues without making significant changes to the softwareâ€™s core functionality.
  
- **Data Type:** 
  - Integer

- **Example Values:**
  - `0`: The initial minor version for a major release.
  - `1`: Represents the first minor update after the major release.
  - `2`: Indicates a second minor update within the same major version.

- **Usage:**
  - The minor version helps in tracking incremental improvements and maintaining a chronological history of updates within a major version. It provides a finer granularity of versioning compared to major numbers.

- **Typical Values:**
  - Minor version numbers often start from `0` and increment as updates are released. For example, in a version `1.2`, `2` is the minor version following `1.1`.

- **Possible Constraints:**
  - Minor version numbers should also be positive integers and should reset to `0` when the major version is incremented.
  - Ensure consistency with how minor versions are updated (e.g., not skipping numbers).

## Dataset Example

The dataset might look as follows:

| major | minor |
|-------|-------|
| 1     | 0     |
| 1     | 1     |
| 1     | 2     |
| 2     | 0     |
| 2     | 1     |
| 3     | 0     |

**Explanation:**

- **Row 1:** Represents the first release of the first major version of the software.
- **Row 2:** Indicates a minor update to the first major version.
- **Row 3:** Shows another incremental update within the same major version.
- **Row 4:** Marks the beginning of a new major version.
- **Row 5:** Represents a minor update in the second major version.
- **Row 6:** Starts a new major version cycle with a minor release.

## Data Handling

- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Ensure no missing values for both `major` and `minor` columns.
  - Handle inconsistencies in version numbering (e.g., incorrect formats or out-of-order versions).

- **Preprocessing:**
  - Normalize or scale features if needed for specific modeling techniques.
  - Convert version numbers into features suitable for machine learning algorithms (e.g., using feature engineering to capture version increments).
