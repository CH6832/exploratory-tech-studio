# Monitoring Plan

## Overview

The monitoring plan is essential to ensure that the deployed model performs optimally in a real-world environment. Continuous monitoring helps in detecting issues early, maintaining model accuracy, and ensuring that the model remains effective as it encounters new data and operational conditions. This document provides a comprehensive strategy for monitoring the model's performance, accuracy, and operational efficiency.

## Monitoring Aspects

### 1. **Accuracy**

**Objective:**
- Ensure that the model’s predictions remain accurate over time and that it continues to meet the performance benchmarks established during training.

**Monitoring Activities:**

- **Performance Metrics:**
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measures the average magnitude of errors in predictions, providing an intuitive understanding of prediction accuracy.
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Reflects the square root of the average squared errors, emphasizing larger errors more significantly.
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures the average of the squares of errors, which is useful for understanding the model’s variance.

- **Monitoring Frequency:**
  - **Real-Time Monitoring:** Implement real-time tracking of model predictions and compare them against actual values.
  - **Scheduled Evaluations:** Conduct regular evaluations using a validation set or recent data at scheduled intervals (e.g., weekly, monthly).

- **Data Collection:**
  - **Prediction Logs:** Maintain logs of model predictions and actual outcomes.
  - **Feedback Mechanism:** Collect user feedback and reports to identify any discrepancies or performance issues.

- **Alerting and Notifications:**
  - **Thresholds:** Set accuracy thresholds that trigger alerts if the model’s performance falls below acceptable levels.
  - **Notification Systems:** Use automated notification systems (e.g., email, SMS) to alert stakeholders of performance degradation.

**Example Metrics Monitoring:**
```bash
# Calculate MAE
python calculate_metrics.py --predictions predictions.csv --actuals actuals.csv --metric MAE

# Calculate RMSE
python calculate_metrics.py --predictions predictions.csv --actuals actuals.csv --metric RMSE
```

### 2. **Performance**

**Objective:**
- Ensure that the model operates efficiently with respect to inference time and resource utilization, thereby maintaining optimal operational performance.

**Monitoring Activities:**

- **Inference Time:**
  - **Latency:** Measure the time taken for the model to produce predictions (end-to-end inference time).
  - **Benchmarking:** Regularly benchmark inference times against predefined performance goals to ensure timely responses.

- **Resource Usage:**
  - **CPU and Memory Usage:** Monitor the CPU and memory consumption during model inference to ensure that resources are used efficiently.
  - **Disk I/O:** Track disk read/write operations if the model interacts with file systems.

- **Monitoring Tools:**
  - **Performance Monitoring Tools:** Utilize tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or cloud-native monitoring solutions (e.g., AWS CloudWatch) to track performance metrics.
  - **Profiling:** Perform regular profiling to identify and address performance bottlenecks.

- **Data Collection:**
  - **System Logs:** Collect and analyze system logs related to resource usage and inference performance.
  - **Real-Time Metrics:** Implement real-time metrics collection and visualization to monitor resource usage dynamically.

- **Alerting and Notifications:**
  - **Thresholds:** Set resource usage thresholds to trigger alerts if the model’s resource consumption exceeds acceptable levels.
  - **Notification Systems:** Use automated alerts to notify system administrators of performance issues or resource overutilization.

**Example Performance Monitoring:**
```bash
# Measure inference time
python measure_inference_time.py --model model.tflite --data input_data.csv --output inference_times.csv

# Monitor CPU and memory usage
top -b -n 1 | grep 'model_inference_process'
```

## Maintenance and Optimization

### **Regular Reviews:**
- **Monthly Reviews:** Conduct monthly reviews of monitoring data to identify trends and potential issues.
- **Quarterly Audits:** Perform quarterly audits to reassess monitoring strategies and update performance benchmarks if necessary.

### **Continuous Improvement:**
- **Model Tuning:** Use monitoring insights to make necessary adjustments to the model or retrain with updated data to improve accuracy and performance.
- **Infrastructure Optimization:** Optimize the deployment infrastructure based on performance data to ensure efficient resource usage and reduced latency.
