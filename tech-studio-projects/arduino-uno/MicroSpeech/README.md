# Keyword Spotting on Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense

This project demonstrates how to deploy a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) Keyword Spotting (KWS) model on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense. The setup enables the board to detect specific keywords from audio input and take actions based on the detected keywords.

## Project Overview

This project involves running a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model for Keyword Spotting on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense. The model is used to classify audio input into different keywords, with actions triggered based on the detected keyword. For this example, the board's built-in LED is used to indicate keyword detection.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense
- USB cable for connecting the Arduino to your computer
- (Optional) External microphone if higher quality audio input is needed

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE (latest version recommended)
- TensorFlow Lite Micro library for Arduino
- Arduino TensorFlow Lite library
- Relevant board support package for Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Arduino IDE**:
   - Download and install the Arduino IDE from [Arduino's official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

2. **Install Board Support**:
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Go to `Tools` > `Board` > `Boards Manager`.
   - Search for "Arduino Nano 33 BLE" and install the package.

3. **Install Libraries**:
   - Go to `Sketch` > `Include Library` > `Manage Libraries`.
   - Search for and install the following libraries:
     - `TensorFlowLite`
     - `TensorFlowLite_Arduino`

4. **Prepare TensorFlow Lite Model**:
   - Convert your KWS model to TensorFlow Lite format.
   - Integrate the model file into the Arduino project as `KWS_model.cc`.

5. **Upload Code to Arduino**:
   - Connect your Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense to your computer.
   - Open the provided Arduino sketch (`micro_speech.ino`) in the Arduino IDE.
   - Select the correct board and port in `Tools` > `Board` and `Tools` > `Port`.
   - Click the upload button to flash the code onto the Arduino.

## Code Explanation

- **Initialization**: Sets up TensorFlow Lite, allocates tensors, and initializes audio input.
- **Preprocessing**: Converts audio data into a format suitable for inference.
- **Inference**: Runs the TensorFlow Lite model to classify audio data.
- **Post-processing**: Interprets the model output and controls an LED based on the detected keyword.

## Usage

1. **Power the Arduino**: Connect it to your computer or a suitable power source.
2. **Speak Keywords**: Use the onboard microphone to capture audio.
3. **Observe LED Behavior**: The LED on the board will change its state based on the detected keyword.

## Troubleshooting

- **No LED Response**: Check your model file and ensure it's correctly integrated. Verify the audio input setup.
- **Inaccurate Keyword Detection**: Ensure your model is properly trained and calibrated. Verify that the audio preprocessing matches the model's requirements.
