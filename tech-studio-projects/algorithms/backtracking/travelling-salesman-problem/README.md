# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Algorithm

This folder contains the code implementation and explanation for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a backtracking approach.

## Description

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known optimization problem in computer science. It seeks to find the shortest possible route that visits each city in a given set exactly once and returns to the starting city. This problem has various applications in areas like logistics, route planning, and circuit design.

## Algorithm

This implementation utilizes a backtracking algorithm to explore different possible routes. It starts at the starting city and recursively explores neighboring unvisited cities. At each step, it checks if the current path leads to a promising solution (e.g., keeping track of the shortest distance found so far) and avoids revisiting cities or exceeding a distance limit. If a complete valid route (visiting all cities and returning to the start) is found with a shorter distance than previously encountered, it updates the best solution. Backtracking occurs when a path leads to a dead end (no valid next move).

Note: Backtracking can be computationally expensive for large datasets due to the exploration of a vast number of potential paths.

* **Time Complexity:** O(n^n) in the worst case, where n is the number of cities. This is because the algorithm explores all possible permutations of cities. However, in practice, the complexity can be lower depending on pruning techniques and early termination strategies.

* **Space Complexity:** O(n) due to the recursion stack used to keep track of the explored path.
