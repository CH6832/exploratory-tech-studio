## **Project Overview**

This project is a fully-fledged **Flask web application** designed to facilitate a typical **data science workflow**. The application allows users to upload datasets, perform data preprocessing, run exploratory data analysis (EDA), select features, train machine learning models, and view the results. 

It automates key stages of a data science project in a simple, easy-to-use web interface.

The main objective of this project is to offer a hands-on platform for aspiring data scientists to practice, learn, and apply data science techniques, all while making the workflow easily reproducible and interactive.

## **Features**

- **Data Upload**: Upload CSV files directly into the application.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Automatic handling of data cleaning, missing value treatment, and scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summary statistics and initial insights into the dataset.
- **Feature Selection**: Select relevant features for machine learning models.
- **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model (Random Forest by default) on the uploaded dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: Get model accuracy, and other performance metrics.
- **Download Results**: Ability to download the trained model for future use.

## **Project Workflow**

This application follows a structured **data science project workflow**:

1. **Problem Understanding**: Define the problem, objective, and success metrics.
2. **Data Collection**: Upload data through the web interface.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, normalization, feature engineering.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Generate summary statistics and visualize data patterns.
5. **Feature Selection**: Select important features based on insights.
6. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models using the selected features.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using test data and performance metrics.
8. **Model Deployment**: Download trained models (optional).
9. **Monitoring**: Monitor model performance and data drift (for future enhancements).

## **Tech Stack**

- **Backend**: Flask (Python web framework)
- **Frontend**: Jinja2 (for rendering HTML templates), Bootstrap (for styling)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (Random Forest, preprocessing), Pandas, Numpy
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn (for future enhancements)
- **Database**: SQLite (optional, for storing model results)
- **Deployment**: Flask’s development server (can be extended to cloud platforms)

## **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.7+**
- **pip** (Python package manager)

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/data-science-flask-app.git
cd data-science-flask-app
```

### 2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

It is recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. **Install Dependencies**

Install the required Python packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. **Run the Application**

You can run the application using Flask’s built-in development server.

```bash
python app.py
```

Go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the web app.

### Key Files:

- **`app.py`**: The main Flask application where routes and business logic are defined.
- **`templates/`**: HTML files using Jinja2 for rendering dynamic content (data upload, model results, etc.).
- **`utils/`**: Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing (`data_preprocessing.py`), model training (`model_training.py`), and feature engineering (`feature_engineering.py`).

## **Usage**

### 1. **Upload Dataset**

- Go to the **Upload** page (`/upload`).
- Upload your dataset in **CSV** format. Make sure your dataset has a target variable column named `target`.

### 2. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- After uploading, you’ll be redirected to the **EDA** page.
- Summary statistics and an initial exploration of the data will be shown, helping you understand the dataset's structure.

### 3. **Select Features for Model Training**

- Choose the relevant features from the list of columns.
- You’ll be redirected to the model training page once the features are selected.

### 4. **Train and Evaluate the Model**

- The application will train a **Random Forest** model by default on the selected features.
- You’ll be able to see model performance (accuracy) on a test set after training.

### 5. **Model Results**

- View the evaluation metrics on the **Results** page.
- Download the trained model if needed for deployment or further use.

## **Future Enhancements**

1. **Add More Models**: Expand the model selection beyond Random Forest to include other classifiers (e.g., SVM, XGBoost).
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Implement a UI for hyperparameter optimization.
3. **Data Visualization**: Add interactive data visualizations using **Plotly** or **Bokeh**.
4. **Model Deployment**: Extend deployment capabilities to cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP).
5. **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring for deployed models, including logging and model drift detection.
6. **Database Integration**: Store information about datasets, models, and their performance in a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).
