"""
This script provides functions for predicting and evaluating the performance of a model.

The `predict` function uses a model to generate predictions based on a threshold. 
The `print_stats` function calculates and prints the accuracy, precision, and recall of the predictions.

Dependencies:
    - TensorFlow
    - scikit-learn

Functions:
    - predict: Generate predictions using the model and a specified threshold.
    - print_stats: Print accuracy, precision, and recall based on predictions and true labels.

        model: The trained model used for predictions (a TensorFlow/Keras model).
        data: The input data for prediction.

        Tuple: A tuple containing:
            - predictions (tf.Tensor): Boolean tensor indicating whether the loss is below the threshold.
