"""
Main script for training and evaluating a machine learning model.

This script includes functions to load and prepare data, build and train a model, 
evaluate the model's performance, and calculate metrics such as ROC AUC. 

Each function is intended to interact with specific modules or scripts, which may 
include separate files for data preparation, model building, training, evaluation, 
ROC AUC calculation, and threshold selection.

Functions:
    - load_and_prepare_data: Load and prepare the data for training and testing.
    - build_model: Build the machine learning model.
    - train_model: Train the model using the training data.
    - evaluate_model: Evaluate the model using normal and anomalous data.
    - calculate_roc_auc: Calculate the ROC AUC metric.
    - select_threshold: Select a threshold for decision making based on the model.
