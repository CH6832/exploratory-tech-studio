# Responsible AI with Google's What-If Tool (WIT)

## Introduction

This repository provides a guided notebook for exploring and analyzing the UCI census dataset to identify and mitigate sources of unfairness using Google's What-If Tool (WIT). The notebook will walk you through training a Deep Neural Network (DNN) on the UCI census dataset and visualizing the results with WIT.

## Structure

The notebook is divided into three main parts:

1. **Part 1: Setup and Training**
   - Install necessary libraries.
   - Define helper functions.
   - Load and preprocess the UCI dataset.
   - Train the DNN classifier.

2. **Part 2: Exploring with What-If Tool**
   - Launch and configure the What-If Tool.
   - Use the tool to explore model performance and fairness.
   - Apply different fairness strategies and analyze their impact.

3. **Part 3: Knowledge Check**
   - Answer questions to self-evaluate understanding of the concepts.

## Installation

To use this notebook, you need to run it in Google Colab. The notebook will automatically install the required `witwidget` package.

## Usage

1. **Run the notebook** to install packages and set up the environment.
2. **Follow the instructions** in Part 2 to interact with the What-If Tool and explore the dataset.
3. **Answer the knowledge check questions** in Part 3 to test your understanding.
