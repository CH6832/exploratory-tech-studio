## 1. Introduction

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to use the Backtesting Module of the Portfolio Management Simulation System. The module is designed to help traders and developers simulate the performance of trading strategies using historical data, analyze the results, and optimize their strategies before deploying them in live markets.

---

## 2. What is Backtesting?

Backtesting is the process of evaluating a trading strategy by applying it to historical market data. It allows traders to:
- Assess the strategy's performance in past market conditions.
- Identify potential risks and weaknesses.
- Refine and optimize parameters to improve future results.

---

## 3. Key Components of the Backtesting Module

### Historical Data
- Accurate, granular historical market data (e.g., tick-by-tick, OHLC).
- Time-stamped trade and order book data to simulate realistic trading environments.

### Trading Strategy
- The algorithm defining entry, exit, and risk management rules.
- Strategies can include technical indicators, statistical models, or machine learning.

### Simulation Engine
- Processes historical data and executes strategy logic.
- Simulates order matching, slippage, and trading fees.

### Metrics and Analysis
- Performance metrics: total return, drawdown, Sharpe ratio, etc.
- Visualizations: equity curves, P&L distributions, and heatmaps.

---

## 4. Preparing for Backtesting

### Data Requirements
- **Accuracy**: Use clean and verified historical data to avoid skewed results.
- **Granularity**: Match data resolution (e.g., minute, hourly) to strategy requirements.
- **Format**: Data should be in JSON, CSV, or database format.

### Strategy Definition
- Define clear rules for entry, exit, position sizing, and risk management.
- Ensure the strategy logic is modular and parameterized for testing.

---

## 5. Running a Backtest

### Step 1: Setting Up
Ensure the system is installed and configured. Use the command-line tool or API to access the backtesting module.

### Step 2: Defining the Backtest Parameters
Parameters to specify:
- **Strategy ID**: The unique identifier of the strategy to be tested.
- **Time Range**: The start and end dates for the test (e.g., `2023-01-01` to `2024-01-01`).
- **Market Data**: The data source and symbols to include.
- **Execution Costs**: Assumptions for slippage and trading fees.

Example JSON payload:
```json
{
  "strategy_id": "mean_reversion_001",
  "start_date": "2023-01-01",
  "end_date": "2024-01-01",
  "symbols": ["AAPL", "GOOG"],
  "execution_costs": {
    "slippage": 0.01,
    "fees": 0.0005
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Executing the Backtest
Use the command:
```bash
backtesting-cli run --config backtest_config.json
```

Or the API:
```http
POST /api/v1/backtesting
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <your_token>

{
  "strategy_id": "mean_reversion_001",
  "start_date": "2023-01-01",
  "end_date": "2024-01-01",
  "symbols": ["AAPL", "GOOG"]
}
```

### Step 4: Analyzing the Results
- **Output Format**: Results are returned in JSON or CSV.
- **Metrics**:
  ```json
  {
    "total_return": 15.3,
    "max_drawdown": -7.8,
    "sharpe_ratio": 1.2,
    "trades": [
      {"symbol": "AAPL", "entry_date": "2023-03-01", "exit_date": "2023-03-10", "pnl": 3.5},
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Visualization**: Use the dashboard or plotting libraries (e.g., matplotlib) to visualize performance.

---

## 6. Example: Backtesting a Mean-Reversion Strategy

### Strategy Logic
- **Entry Rule**: Buy when the price is below the 20-day moving average by 5%.  
- **Exit Rule**: Sell when the price returns to the moving average.

### Backtest Configuration
```json
{
  "strategy_id": "mean_reversion_001",
  "start_date": "2023-01-01",
  "end_date": "2023-12-31",
  "symbols": ["MSFT"],
  "execution_costs": {
    "slippage": 0.01,
    "fees": 0.0005
  }
}
```

### Results
- **Metrics**:
  - Total Return: 12.5%
  - Max Drawdown: -5.2%
  - Sharpe Ratio: 1.4
- **Trade Log**:
  ```json
  [
    {"entry_date": "2023-05-01", "exit_date": "2023-05-15", "symbol": "MSFT", "pnl": 4.2},
    {"entry_date": "2023-09-01", "exit_date": "2023-09-10", "symbol": "MSFT", "pnl": 3.1}
  ]
  ```

## 7. Best Practices

1. **Use High-Quality Data**: Avoid testing on unreliable data sources.
2. **Run Multiple Scenarios**: Test under varying market conditions and assumptions.
3. **Analyze Metrics Holistically**: Focus on both returns and risk measures like drawdowns.

## 8. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

| Pitfall                     | Solution                                   |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Overfitting                 | Avoid excessive tuning of strategy parameters. |
| Ignoring Transaction Costs  | Include realistic fees and slippage assumptions. |
| Inconsistent Data           | Ensure data integrity and alignment with time zones. |
| Unrealistic Assumptions     | Test with realistic market conditions. |

## 9. Glossary

- **Backtesting**: Simulating a strategyâ€™s performance on historical data.
- **Drawdown**: The peak-to-trough decline in a portfolio or strategy.
- **Sharpe Ratio**: A measure of risk-adjusted return.
- **Slippage**: The difference between expected and actual execution price.
