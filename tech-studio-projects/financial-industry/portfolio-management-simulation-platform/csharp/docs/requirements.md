## Scope of Work  

### Core Components  

#### **Market Data Ingestion**  
- Integrate real-time data feeds from multiple sources (e.g., exchanges, brokers).  
- Normalize data formats for internal processing.  
- Support WebSocket and REST APIs for streaming and snapshot data.  

#### **Strategy Engine**  
- Execute multiple strategies concurrently with **async/await**.  
- Allow users to upload and test custom strategies using a sandboxed environment.  
- Include **Roslyn Compiler API** for on-the-fly compilation and testing.  

#### **Order Management System (OMS)**  
- Manage the lifecycle of all orders: creation, updates, cancellations, and execution.  
- Maintain a real-time portfolio tracking system.  
- Expose RESTful APIs for order operations.  

#### **Execution Management System (EMS)**  
- Handle order execution and routing with low-latency connections to brokers or exchanges.  
- Support advanced order types and execution algorithms.  

#### **Risk Management Module**  
- Enforce pre-trade and post-trade risk checks (e.g., position size, exposure limits).  
- Provide real-time monitoring of compliance with configured risk policies.  

#### **Backtesting Engine**  
- Simulate strategies using historical market data.  
- Provide detailed performance metrics and risk analytics.  
- Ensure near-real-time simulation for large datasets.  

#### **Data Storage and Analytics**  
- Store transactional and historical data using **PostgreSQL**.  
- Utilize **Redis** for caching and **TimescaleDB** for time-series analysis.  

#### **User Interface (UI) & Monitoring**  
- Develop a responsive Angular-based dashboard for monitoring system health, metrics, and performance.  
- Implement real-time data streaming with **SignalR** for interactive charts and updates.  

---

### Non-Functional Requirements  

#### **Performance**  
- Achieve sub-10 ms latency for critical operations like order processing.  
- Support throughput of 10,000 operations per second.  

#### **Scalability**  
- Enable horizontal scaling using Kubernetes for data ingestion and processing.  

#### **Security**  
- Employ robust authentication and authorization using **JWT**.  
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.  

#### **Availability**  
- Maintain 99.99% uptime through redundancy and failover mechanisms.  

#### **Reliability**  
- Implement automated disaster recovery and fault-tolerant components.
