## Project Goals

- **Objective**: Optimize a financial portfolio by balancing risk (variance) and expected return, using quantum algorithms to manage complexity more effectively than classical algorithms.
- **Optimization Goal**: Maximize returns while minimizing risk for a given set of financial assets.
- **Classical Benchmark**: Compare against the Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization approach.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Research and Background Study

- **Portfolio Optimization**:
  - Understand portfolio optimization problems (e.g., maximizing expected returns for a given risk).
  - Explore constraints such as investment limits, asset liquidity, and risk tolerance.
  - Study classical optimization approaches, including:
    - Mean-Variance Optimization (Markowitz Model)
    - Linear Programming for Risk Minimization

- **Quantum Algorithms**:
  - **QAOA**: A quantum-classical hybrid algorithm suitable for combinatorial optimization, adaptable to portfolio optimization by formulating it as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem.
  - **Grover’s Search**: Enhances search-based optimization by reducing time complexity, useful for exploring possible portfolio configurations.

### Phase 2: Algorithm Selection and Formulation

- **QAOA Implementation**:
  - Formulate the portfolio optimization as a QUBO problem.
  - Use QAOA to approximate optimal portfolio allocations.
  - Assess trade-offs between accuracy and complexity at different QAOA levels (depth).
  
- **Grover’s Search**:
  - Map the search problem to Grover's algorithm.
  - Implement Grover's oracle to reflect financial constraints.

### Phase 3: Set Up the Development Environment

- **Tools and Libraries**:
  - **Qiskit (Python)**: Use Qiskit for quantum algorithms, integrating it into a C++ project via wrappers like `pybind11`.
  - **C++ Development Environment**: CLion or Visual Studio for algorithm and financial data handling.
  - **CMake**: For project management and compilation.
  - **QUBO Solvers**: Integrate or develop a QUBO solver.

### Phase 4: Implementation

- **Data Handling**:
  - Load financial data from CSV files.
  - Preprocess data to calculate covariance and expected returns.

- **QUBO Formulation**:
  - Define binary decision variables for asset inclusion and formulate the cost function.
  - Incorporate constraints, such as total budget.

- **Quantum Algorithm Implementation**:
  - Implement QAOA and Grover's search algorithms.
  
- **Classical Algorithm**:
  - Implement a classical optimizer for baseline comparisons.
