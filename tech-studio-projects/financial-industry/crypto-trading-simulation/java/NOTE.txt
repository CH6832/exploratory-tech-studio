@echo off
REM Start the cryptocurrency market-making platform

echo Starting the cryptocurrency market-making platform...

REM Check if the market_maker executable exists
IF EXIST ".\build\market_maker.exe" (
    .\build\market_maker.exe
) ELSE (
    echo Error: Market Maker executable not found. Please build the project first.
    exit /b 1
)

echo Market-making platform started.

2. deploy.bat

batch

@echo off
REM Deploy the cryptocurrency market-making platform using Docker Compose

echo Deploying the cryptocurrency market-making platform...

REM Build and deploy containers

)

echo Deployment completed successfully!

3. stop.bat

batch

@echo off
REM Stop the cryptocurrency market-making platform

echo Stopping the cryptocurrency market-making platform...

REM Stop the Docker containers
docker-compose down

IF ERRORLEVEL 1 (
    echo Failed to stop the platform!
    exit /b 1
)

echo Platform stopped successfully!

Summary of Scripts

    start.bat: Checks for the presence of the market_maker.exe executable in the build directory and starts it if found. Otherwise, it reports an error and exits.
    deploy.bat: Uses Docker Compose to build and deploy the application containers. It checks for errors during the deployment process and reports success or failure.
    stop.bat: Stops the running Docker containers for the market-making platform and checks for any errors during the stop process.

Explanation

    MarketMakerTest:
        This test suite checks the starting and stopping functionality of the MarketMaker class.
        It includes tests for interacting with the RiskManager, OrderRouter, and MarketDataFeed, ensuring that each component can perform its core functions without throwing exceptions.

    OrderRouterTest:
        This test suite specifically tests the OrderRouter class.
        It validates that the order routing and start/stop functionalities work as intended.

Dependencies

To compile and run these tests, make sure you have the Google Test framework installed and linked correctly in your build system. You might need to add the necessary flags in your Makefile to include Google Test libraries when compiling the test files.
Conclusion

With these files, you now have the complete unit tests to validate the functionality of your market-making application components. If you have further questions or need additional components, feel free to ask!

Complete Source Code for test_order_router.cpp
test_order_router.cpp

cpp

#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include "core/order_router/OrderRouter.h"

class OrderRouterTest : public ::testing::Test {
protected:
    OrderRouter orderRouter;

    void SetUp() override {
        // Initialize resources before each test
        orderRouter.start();
    }

    void TearDown() override {
        // Clean up resources after each test
        orderRouter.stop();
    }
};

TEST_F(OrderRouterTest, RouteOrder) {
    // Test routing an order
    EXPECT_NO_THROW(orderRouter.routeOrder());
}

TEST_F(OrderRouterTest, StartStop) {
    // Test starting and stopping the order router
    EXPECT_NO_THROW(orderRouter.start());
    EXPECT_NO_THROW(orderRouter.stop());
}

Explanation

    Test Fixture:
        OrderRouterTest is a test fixture that sets up an instance of OrderRouter before each test runs (SetUp()) and ensures it stops after each test (TearDown()).

    Test Cases:
        RouteOrder Test: This test checks that calling routeOrder() does not throw any exceptions, ensuring that the method works as expected.
        StartStop Test: This test verifies that starting and stopping the OrderRouter instance does not throw any exceptions, confirming that the lifecycle methods work properly.

Dependencies

Make sure you have the Google Test framework set up in your development environment. If you haven't done this yet, you can include it in your project via a package manager or by cloning the Google Test repository and building it manually.
How to Compile and Run the Tests

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how you might compile and run the tests using a Makefile:
Sample Makefile

makefile

CXX = g++
CXXFLAGS = -std=c++17 -I./ -I./third_party/googletest/include -pthread

# Add Google Test source files
GTEST_SRC = ./third_party/googletest/src/gtest-all.cc

# Directories
SRC_DIR = ./src
TEST_DIR = ./tests

# Source files
SRC_FILES = $(wildcard $(SRC_DIR)/**/*.cpp)
TEST_FILES = $(wildcard $(TEST_DIR)/*.cpp)

# Output executable
TARGET = test_runner

# Build rules
all: $(TARGET)

$(TARGET): $(SRC_FILES) $(TEST_FILES) $(GTEST_SRC)
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -o $@ $^ $(GTEST_SRC) -lgtest -lgtest_main -lpthread

clean:
	rm -f $(TARGET)

Run the Tests

After compiling, you can run the tests using the generated executable:

bash

./test_runner

This should execute all test cases and report any failures or issues.
Conclusion

With this addition, you now have the complete source code for the test_order_router.cpp file, ensuring that the OrderRouter class is thoroughly tested. If you have any more questions or need additional code, feel free to ask!

    marketMaker.stop(); // Ensure market maker is stopped
}

Explanation

    Includes: The code includes necessary headers for Google Test and for timing functions.

    Order Routing Performance Test:
        simulateOrderRouting: This helper function simulates order routing by repeatedly calling the routeOrder() method of the OrderRouter class.
        RoutingPerformance Test: This test measures the time it takes to route multiple orders and checks that this time is within an acceptable limit (less than 500 milliseconds in this case).

    Market Making Performance Test:
        MarketMakingPerformance Test: This test measures the time it takes to start and stop the MarketMaker a number of times (1000 in this case) and checks that this operation is efficient (less than 1000 milliseconds).

How to Run the Performance Tests

To run these tests, you can include the new performance_tests.cpp file in your build process. Make sure it is added to your Makefile:
Example Makefile Update

makefile

# Add this line to include performance tests
TEST_FILES = $(wildcard $(TEST_DIR)/*.cpp) performance_tests.cpp

Compile and Run

Once updated, you can compile and run all tests (including performance tests) as before:

bash

make all
./test_runner

Conclusion

With this addition, you now have a performance testing suite for both the OrderRouter and MarketMaker components of your trading system. If you need further modifications or additional tests, feel free to ask!

    std::string message = tcpClient.receive();
    EXPECT_EQ(message, "test"); // Check if the received message is as expected
}

Explanation

    Mock Classes:
        Both MockWebSocketClient and MockTcpClient inherit from their respective classes and override key methods to simulate behavior without actually making network calls. This allows you to isolate tests from real network interactions, which can be unreliable and slow.

    Tests for WebSocket Client:
        ConnectTest: Checks that the client can connect without throwing an exception.
        SendMessageTest: Validates that sending a message does not throw an exception.
        ReceiveMessageTest: Ensures that receiving a message returns the expected string.

    Tests for TCP Client:
        ConnectTest: Checks that the TCP client can connect to the specified IP and port without throwing an exception.
        SendMessageTest: Validates that sending a message does not throw an exception.
        ReceiveMessageTest: Ensures that receiving a message returns the expected string.

How to Compile and Run the Network Tests

To run these tests, ensure the new files are added to your Makefile:
Example Makefile Update

makefile

# Add these lines to include network tests
NETWORK_TEST_FILES = network_tests/test_websocket_client.cpp network_tests/test_tcp_client.cpp
TEST_FILES = $(wildcard $(TEST_DIR)/*.cpp) $(NETWORK_TEST_FILES)

Compile and Run

Once updated, compile and run all tests as follows:

bash

make all
./test_runner

Conclusion

With these files, you now have a comprehensive set of network tests that ensure the functionality of your WebSocket and TCP clients. If you have further questions or need additional components, feel free to ask!

    Risk Manager (RiskManager): Monitors trading positions to manage risk, ensuring that potential losses remain within acceptable limits.
    Order Router (OrderRouter): Handles the routing of orders to various exchanges based on the trading strategy and market conditions.
    Market Data Feed (MarketDataFeed): Interfaces with exchanges to receive real-time market data, providing necessary inputs for trading strategies.
    Performance Metrics (PerformanceMetrics): Analyzes the system's performance, measuring key metrics like profit/loss, execution speed, etc.

Example Interaction:

    The MarketMaker receives data from the MarketDataFeed, processes it, and makes decisions on whether to buy or sell. It sends orders through the OrderRouter, which interacts with the relevant exchange.

3. Network Components
Network Modules Overview

    WebSocket Client (WebSocketClient): Maintains a persistent connection to the exchange for real-time data and order updates.
    TCP Client (TcpClient): Used for point-to-point communication with other services or components in the architecture.
    P2P Communication (P2PClient and P2PServer): Allows direct communication between peers in the network, useful for sharing market data or signals.
    Multicast Communication (MulticastClient and MulticastServer): Enables sending messages to multiple subscribers at once, ideal for broadcasting market data updates.

Example Interaction:

    The WebSocketClient receives live updates from the exchange. The MarketDataFeed consumes this data, while the OrderRouter utilizes the TCP connection to send orders to the exchange.

4. Utilities
Utility Modules Overview

    Logger (Logger): Provides logging capabilities for monitoring and debugging the system, ensuring that all actions and events are recorded.
    Configuration Manager (Config): Manages configuration settings that define the behavior of the trading system, such as API keys, trading strategies, and risk parameters.

5. Automation and Deployment
Automation Scripts

    deploy.sh: Script for deploying the trading system to a server, ensuring that all components are correctly set up.
    start.sh: Script to start the trading system, initializing all necessary services and components.
    stop.sh: Script to gracefully shut down the trading system, ensuring that all connections are properly closed and data is saved.

Docker and Compose

    Dockerfile: Contains instructions for building a Docker image of the trading system, allowing for consistent deployment across different environments.

    Performance Tests: Assess the system's performance under load, ensuring that it can handle high-frequency trading scenarios.
    Network Tests: Validate that the P2P and multicast communications work as intended.

7. How It All Works Together

Letâ€™s put it all together with a flow of operations:

    Initialization:
        When the system starts, the start.sh script is executed. This may launch multiple components (servers, clients, etc.) within Docker containers.

    Market Data Acquisition:
        The MarketDataFeed starts receiving real-time market data via the WebSocketClient. This data feeds into the MarketMaker, which analyzes it.

    Decision Making:
        The MarketMaker utilizes predefined algorithms to decide on trades. For example, if it identifies an arbitrage opportunity, it may place simultaneous buy and sell orders.

    Order Routing:
        The OrderRouter receives these orders and routes them to the appropriate exchange. It does this using the TcpClient for point-to-point connections or the WebSocketClient for real-time order execution.

    Risk Management:
        Throughout this process, the RiskManager monitors positions and exposure, ensuring that any open positions remain within acceptable risk parameters.

    Performance Tracking:
        The PerformanceMetrics component continuously tracks the systemâ€™s performance, providing insights into profit/loss and execution times.

    Communication:
        If there are multiple instances of this trading system running (e.g., for load balancing), the P2P and multicast communication modules can share data and trading signals among them, ensuring synchronized operations.

    Logging and Monitoring:
        All actions taken by the system (such as order placements and errors) are logged by the Logger. This is essential for debugging and auditing purposes.

    Automation:
        If any updates are needed (such as changing strategies or configurations), the deploy.sh script can be executed to redeploy or update components without significant downtime.

    Testing:
        Before deployment, unit tests and integration tests can be run to ensure all components are functioning correctly. If any test fails, the issue can be addressed before moving to production.

Conclusion

This detailed overview should give you a comprehensive understanding of how all components in the trading system work together to form a cohesive, highly performant cryptocurrency trading platform. Each module has its specific role, and together they contribute to achieving the overall goal of effective market-making and risk management in cryptocurrency options trading. If you have further questions or need additional details, feel free to ask!

Real-World Enterprise Project Example: A Cryptocurrency Exchange Platform
Project Overview:

The enterprise project is a Cryptocurrency Exchange Platform, designed to handle millions of transactions, thousands of concurrent users, and billions in trading volume across different cryptocurrency assets. The platform consists of backend services, API layers, and microservices that support high availability, real-time data streaming, and event-driven architecture.

This project has over 1,000,000 lines of code, mainly written in Python and supported by a modern microservices architecture with a focus on scalability, performance, and reliability. It leverages cutting-edge technologies such as AWS cloud services, event-driven architecture with Kafka, and a combination of relational and NoSQL databases.
Alignment with Job Description:
1. Drive Key Technical Decisions:

    Architecture: The platform uses a microservices architecture to decouple critical services such as order matching, account management, wallet services, and market data aggregation. The choice of tech stack (Python for services, Kafka for messaging) was based on the need for high performance and low latency in processing large volumes of data.
    Engineering Practices: Best practices like Test-Driven Development (TDD), Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), and automated testing are critical. The team adopts SOLID principles, ensuring the software is maintainable and scalable.

2. Backend System Development with Python:

    The platform's backend is entirely built in Python. It includes a set of loosely coupled microservices that manage user authentication, order execution, risk management, and real-time data processing.
    Performance-critical services, such as the matching engine, are optimized for low latency, ensuring trades are processed in real-time.

3. Loosely Coupled Microservices:

    Core Services: The platform operates with core services like User Authentication, Order Matching, Market Data Streaming, and Settlement Systems, all loosely coupled to ensure that individual services can scale independently.
    Deployment: Each microservice is containerized using Docker and orchestrated through Kubernetes in an AWS environment, which allows easy scaling and maintenance.

4. Event-Driven Architecture:

    The platform utilizes Apache Kafka as a message broker to enable the event-driven architecture. For instance, when a new order is placed, an event is published to Kafka, triggering downstream services like risk checks, order matching, and user notifications.
    Services communicate asynchronously through events to minimize tight coupling between components, making the platform more flexible and resilient to changes or failures in individual services.

5. Solve Multi-Dimensional Problems:

    Concurrency & Scalability: Handling thousands of transactions per second with thousands of concurrent users requires high throughput and low-latency solutions. Python-based microservices optimized with asynchronous programming (asyncio) help solve these complex problems.
    Complex Business Logic: The order matching engine has complex logic for matching buy/sell orders, applying fees, and ensuring regulatory compliance. These business rules are optimized for performance without compromising correctness.

Technologies & Qualifications:
1. Python & RestAPI Knowledge:

    The platformâ€™s microservices expose APIs using FastAPI and Flask. These APIs allow third-party developers to interact with the platform, creating bots or custom trading systems.
    RESTful API design follows best practices, such as proper versioning, authentication (OAuth2), and rate-limiting for optimal security and performance.

2. Relational & NoSQL Databases:

    PostgreSQL is used for core transactional data (such as user accounts, trades, and orders), while MongoDB is leveraged for storing unstructured market data.
    A Redis instance is used for caching frequently accessed data, improving system performance.

3. Communication Protocols & WebSockets:

    WebSocket connections are used to provide real-time market data and trade execution notifications to users.
    The platform implements gRPC for high-performance communication between internal services.

4. Event Streams & Message Brokers:

    Kafka handles the event stream for processing all trading-related events asynchronously. When a trade occurs, an event is published to Kafka, which other services (like settlement and audit services) consume.
    RabbitMQ is used for lightweight task queuing and offloading, such as sending emails, SMS notifications, or creating daily reports.

5. Familiarity with AWS Services, Crypto, Blockchain, DevOps:

    AWS is the cloud infrastructure provider. Key services used include S3 for file storage, Lambda for serverless event processing, and DynamoDB for high-throughput key-value storage.
    The system integrates with multiple blockchain nodes to validate transactions, update balances, and manage wallets for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
    CI/CD Pipelines: Jenkins is used to automate the deployment pipeline, ensuring new code is tested and deployed seamlessly.
    Security: The platform includes advanced security features such as two-factor authentication, KMS (Key Management Service) encryption, and role-based access control (RBAC).

Real-World Complexity:

The platform operates in the highly regulated and volatile world of cryptocurrency. It requires constant attention to security, scalability, and performance. The project not only handles a large codebase but also serves a critical role in the financial ecosystem, demanding the highest reliability and uptime.

This project example aligns well with your job description, demonstrating deep experience with Python, REST APIs, microservices, event-driven architecture, and real-time data processing in a high-performance, mission-critical environment.
