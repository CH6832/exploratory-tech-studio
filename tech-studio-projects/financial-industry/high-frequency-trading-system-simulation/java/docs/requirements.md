# High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Simulation Requirements

## **Overview**
This document outlines the requirements for developing a High-Frequency Trading (HFT) simulation system. The system will integrate **monolithic** and **microservices** components to simulate trading operations in a real-time environment. The application will require extremely low-latency, high throughput, and high reliability to mirror the performance characteristics expected in a real-world HFT system.

The system will be built using **Java Real-Time System (Java RTS)** for performance optimization, with **microservices** handling distinct functionalities (market data, risk management, execution, etc.), and a **monolithic core** for order matching and decision-making.

## **Functional Requirements**

### 1. **Core Trading System (Monolithic)**
   - **Order Matching Engine**: Handles the core functionality of matching buy and sell orders based on market conditions.
     - Order types: Market, Limit, Stop-Loss, etc.
     - Order matching criteria: price, time, order book priority, etc.
   - **Risk Management Engine**: Validates the feasibility of trades based on pre-defined risk parameters (margin, liquidity, etc.).
   - **Position Management**: Tracks positions of individual accounts and ensures that trading activities do not exceed available balances or margin limits.

### 2. **Microservices**
   - **Market Data Service**: Responsible for receiving real-time price feeds and order book data from external exchanges and propagating this data to the core trading system.
     - Market data feeds can include price, volume, and order book depth.
   - **Order Service**: Handles the placement, modification, and cancellation of orders.
     - Subscribes to and processes order requests.
   - **Execution Service**: Sends orders to external exchanges for execution and monitors their status (filled, partially filled, canceled).
   - **Risk Service**: Independently validates trades and updates the monolithâ€™s internal risk model.
     - Provides checks against predefined thresholds and market conditions.
   - **Logging & Monitoring**: Provides real-time logging of events and performance metrics to help with troubleshooting and analysis.

### 3. **External Systems**
   - **Trading Exchange**: The external system that receives and executes orders placed by the simulation (e.g., mock API simulating an exchange).
   - **Data Feeds**: External sources providing real-time market data that will be consumed by the system (simulated or live market feeds).

## **Non-Functional Requirements**

### 1. **Performance & Optimization**
   - **Low Latency**: Communication between the monolithic core and microservices must be optimized for minimal delay. The system should aim for sub-millisecond latency for all key actions (e.g., order matching, market data updates).
   - **High Throughput**: The system must support handling thousands of messages per second, including order placement, risk checks, and execution messages.
   - **Scalability**: Microservices should be able to scale horizontally, independently of the monolithic core. For example, the **Market Data Service** should be able to scale to handle large volumes of incoming price feed data.
   - **Fault Tolerance & Reliability**: The system must be robust to failures. If a microservice fails, the monolithic system must continue to operate without data loss. Events should be persisted in a queue and retried in case of failure.
   - **High Availability**: Key services (like the **Market Data Service** and **Execution Service**) should be replicated for high availability, ensuring uninterrupted operation.

### 2. **Architecture & Design**
   - **Hybrid Architecture**: A combination of a **monolithic core** and **microservices** that communicate via **event-driven messaging** (e.g., Kafka, ZeroMQ) or **REST/gRPC APIs**.
     - The **monolithic core** will manage **order matching**, **position management**, and **risk checks**.
     - **Microservices** will handle specific tasks like market data processing, order execution, and independent risk validation.
   - **Message Queues**: High-performance message brokers like **Kafka** or **RabbitMQ** will be used to facilitate communication between microservices and the monolithic system.
   - **Asynchronous Communication**: Event-driven communication ensures that services are decoupled and can process events independently, reducing the impact of latency and bottlenecks.

### 3. **Concurrency & Parallelism**
   - **Multithreading**: Utilize **Java's concurrency features** (e.g., **ExecutorService**, **ForkJoinPool**) to process market data, orders, and risk validation in parallel.
   - **Parallel Processing**: The system should be able to process multiple orders simultaneously, ensuring low latency for trading activities.

## **Technology Stack**

### 1. **Programming Languages & Frameworks**
   - **Java**: The primary language for both the monolithic core and microservices.
     - **Java RTS** (Real-Time System): Used for **real-time, deterministic execution** and minimizing latency in high-throughput scenarios.
   - **Spring Boot**: For building microservices, providing RESTful APIs, and managing service dependencies.
   - **gRPC**: Used for low-latency, high-throughput communication between microservices and the monolithic core (for synchronous communication).
   - **Kafka** / **ZeroMQ**: For **asynchronous event-driven communication** between services.

### 2. **Database**
   - **In-Memory Database** (e.g., **Redis**): For fast read/write operations on order books, trades, and positions.
   - **Relational Database** (e.g., **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**): For persisting trade logs, market history, and audit trails.
   
### 3. **Message Queues**
   - **Kafka**: A distributed streaming platform for high-throughput, low-latency event-driven communication between microservices and the monolithic system.
   - **ZeroMQ**: A high-performance messaging library that is ideal for low-latency, high-frequency messaging between components.
   
### 4. **External Services**
   - **Mock Exchange API**: Simulates communication with a live trading exchange for order execution and market data.
   - **External Market Data Feeds**: Simulated or real market feeds providing real-time market prices and order book data.

## **Security Requirements**

### 1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Services should be secured with **OAuth2** or **API keys** to ensure that only authorized components can access critical services (e.g., placing orders, accessing sensitive trade data).
   
### 2. **Data Integrity**
   - The system must ensure that data exchanged between microservices and the monolithic core is validated and cannot be tampered with during transmission.
   - Use **HTTPS** and **TLS** encryption for communication between microservices.

---

## **Testing & Quality Assurance**

### 1. **Unit Testing**
   - Implement **unit tests** for each component (order matching, risk management, market data handling) to ensure that individual units function correctly.
   - Use frameworks like **JUnit** and **Mockito** for mocking external dependencies in tests.

### 2. **Integration Testing**
   - Perform **end-to-end testing** of the system to verify that the integration between the monolithic core and microservices works as expected, especially the event-driven messaging.
   - Use tools like **TestContainers** for running integration tests with real databases and message queues.

### 3. **Load Testing & Performance Testing**
   - Use tools like **Gatling** or **JMeter** to simulate **high-frequency trading** scenarios and assess system performance under load.
   - Ensure that the system can handle at least **10,000 orders per second** and maintain sub-millisecond latency for critical operations.

## **Deployment & Infrastructure**

### 1. **Containerization**
   - Use **Docker** to containerize microservices and deploy them in a **Kubernetes** cluster for scalable, resilient, and managed deployment.
   
### 2. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Use **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for monitoring performance metrics (latency, throughput, error rates).
   - Implement **centralized logging** with **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or **Splunk** for tracing and debugging.
   
### 3. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Set up **Continuous Integration** using **Jenkins** or **GitHub Actions** for automated builds and testing.
   - Implement **Continuous Deployment** to automatically deploy microservices and the monolithic system to staging/production environments.

## **Example Use Cases**

1. **Market Data Update**:
   - The **Market Data Service** receives real-time price updates from the external exchange and publishes the new data to a Kafka topic.
   - The **Order Matching Engine** in the monolithic system subscribes to the topic and uses the data to update the order book.

2. **Order Execution**:
   - A trader places an order via the **Order Service** (microservice).
   - The order is placed in the message queue and processed by the **Order Matching Engine** in the monolithic system.
   - The **Execution Service** sends the matched order to the external exchange for execution.

3. **Risk Management**:
   - A new trade is submitted to the **Risk Service** via a message queue.
   - The service checks the risk parameters and returns whether the trade is allowed.
   - The **Monolithic Risk Management Engine** uses this information to approve or reject the trade.
