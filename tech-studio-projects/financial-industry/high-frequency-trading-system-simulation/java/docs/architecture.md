   |      **Market Data Service**            |
   |  (Fetches & Publishes Data)            |
   +-------------------+--------------------+
```

### **Explanation:**
- **External Systems**: External exchanges and market data providers communicate with the system using message queues (Kafka, ZeroMQ).
- **Monolithic Core**: The core of the system, handling order matching, risk management, and key logic. It interacts with all services.
- **Microservices**:
  - **Order Service**: Handles order placement and cancellations via REST APIs.
  - **Execution Service**: Responsible for executing trades and communicating with the exchange.
  - **Risk Service**: Validates orders and monitors risk metrics.
  - **Market Data Service**: Fetches market data from external providers and publishes it to the system.

### 2. **Monolithic Core Architecture (Order Matching & Risk Management)**

This diagram focuses on the internal structure of the **monolithic core**, highlighting the major components such as the order matching engine and risk management subsystems.

#### **Diagram 2: Monolithic Core Architecture**

```plaintext
   +----------------------------------------------------------+
   |                **Order Matching Engine**                |
   |   +------------------------+       +------------------+  |
   |   |   Order Matching       |  <--->|   Order Book     |  |
   |   |   Engine               |       +------------------+  |
   |   |                        |       |                  |  |
   |   |  - Price Matching      |       |  - Limit Orders  |  |
   |   |  - Time Matching       |       |  - Market Orders |  |
   +------------------------+       +------------------+  |
              |                                      |
        (Real-Time Matching)                         |
              |                                      |
   +------------------------+         +-----------------------+
   |   **Risk Management**   |         |   **Event Publisher**  |
   |   +------------------+  |         |   (Kafka Producer)     |
   |   | Risk Manager     |  |         +-----------------------+
   |   | - Risk Validator |  |
   |   | - Margin         |  |
   |   | - Exposure       |  |
   +------------------+  |         +-----------------------+
                          |
                          v
                   (Asynchronous Events)
```

### **Explanation:**
- **Order Matching Engine**: Central component for matching buy and sell orders based on price-time priority. It interacts with the order book to check for matching orders.
- **Risk Management**: Checks orders for compliance with risk rules (e.g., margin requirements). If a trade passes risk checks, it triggers the order matching process.
- **Event Publisher**: Asynchronous component for publishing real-time events (order executed, market data updates) to Kafka or other message queues for consumption by microservices.

### 3. **Microservices Interaction Diagram**

This diagram shows how each **microservice** communicates with each other and the monolithic core. The flow of data and the inter-service communication protocols (e.g., Kafka, ZeroMQ, REST) are highlighted.

#### **Diagram 3: Microservices Interaction**

    |   | - Order Validator   |   |   Exchange          |  |
    +--------------------+   +---------------------+  |
         ^                     |                      |
     (Kafka/ZeroMQ)             |                      |
         |                     v                      v
    +-------------------+    +--------------------+    +--------------------+
    | **Risk Service**  |    |  **Market Data Service**  |    |  **Order Service**  |
    |   - Risk Validator |    |  - Fetches Market Data    |    |    (REST APIs)      |
    |   - Margin Calculations|    |  - Publishes to Kafka   |    +--------------------+
    +-------------------+    +--------------------+
```

### **Explanation:**
- **Order Service**: Manages order-related actions and validates orders before they are passed to the matching engine.
- **Execution Service**: Handles order execution, communicates with the exchange, and processes execution status.
- **Risk Service**: Validates orders for risk, calculates exposure, and enforces limits.
- **Market Data Service**: Consumes external market data and streams it to other services using Kafka or other messaging systems.

### 4. **Flow Diagram for Order Matching & Execution**

This diagram depicts the sequence of steps involved when an order is placed, validated, matched, and executed in real-time. This will help visualize the **end-to-end flow**.

#### **Diagram 4: Order Matching & Execution Flow**

```plaintext
  User (Client)
      |
      v
  +--------------------+
  |  Place Order       | (REST API Call)
  +--------------------+
      |
      v
  +----------------------------+
  |  **Order Validation**      |  (Check margin, exposure, etc.)
  |   - Risk Service Validation|
  +----------------------------+
      |
      v
  +----------------------------+
  |   **Order Matching**       |  (Find matching orders in Order Book)
  |   - Monolithic Core        |
  +----------------------------+
      |
      v
  +----------------------------+
  |   **Order Execution**      | (Execute Order via Exchange)
  |   - Execution Service      |
  +----------------------------+
      |
      v
  +----------------------------+
  |   **Publish Execution Event**| (Kafka/ZeroMQ Message)
  +----------------------------+
      |
      v
  +----------------------------+
  |   **Update Order Book**    | (Update status, match results)
  +----------------------------+
      |
      v
  +----------------------------+
  |    **Send Confirmation**   | (Notify client with execution status)
  +----------------------------+
```

### **Explanation:**
- **Place Order**: The user places an order via the Order Service's REST API.
- **Order Validation**: The order is validated for risk by the Risk Service.
- **Order Matching**: The order is matched with the order book in the Monolithic Core.
- **Order Execution**: The Execution Service sends the order to the exchange for execution.
- **Publish Execution Event**: An event is published using Kafka or ZeroMQ.
- **Update Order Book**: The order book is updated with the matched order details.
- **Send Confirmation**: The user is notified with the status of the order (filled, partially filled, rejected).

### 5. **Deployment Diagram (Docker, Kubernetes)**

This diagram shows how the application components (monolithic core, microservices, Kafka, etc.) are deployed and scaled within a **Docker** or **Kubernetes** environment.

#### **Diagram 5: Deployment Diagram**

```plaintext
         +---------------------+        +---------------------+
         |  **Monolithic Core**|        | **Kafka Cluster**   |
         |  (Order Matching,   |        | (Message Queueing)  |
         |   Risk Management)  |        +---------------------+
         |   Docker Container  |               |      |
         +-------------------+                |      |
                    |                          |      |
        +----------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------------+
        | **Order Service**      |   | **Execution Service**  |    | **Market Data Service** |
        | (REST API)             |       | (Order Executor)         | (Fetch Market Data)    |
        | Docker Container       |       | Docker Container         | Docker Container        |
        +----------------------+       +-------------------+       +---------------------------+
                   |                         |                            |
            +----------------------+    +----------------------+      +------------------+
            | **Risk Service**     |   |   **Frontend Client** |    | **Load Balancer** |
            | Docker Container     |   | (API Consumption)     |    | (Traffic routing) |
            +----------------------+    +----------------------+      +------------------+
```

### **Explanation:**
- **Docker Containers**: Each service, whether it's part of the monolith or a microservice, is deployed within a Docker container.
- **Kafka Cluster**: Kafka handles message queueing and communication between services.
- **Load Balancer**: Routes traffic to appropriate service instances (microservices or monolith).
- **Frontend Client**: Could be a trading interface consuming the APIs exposed by your services.
