Overview
    Component Diagram: Helps understand the system’s modular structure and interactions.
    Deployment Diagram: Shows physical deployment on hardware.
    Class Diagram: Details the static structure of the system.
    Sequence Diagram: Details the flow of interactions over time.
    Activity Diagram: Illustrates workflows and processes.

Each of these diagrams provides a different level of detail and perspective on the system, making them valuable for various stages of development and for different stakeholders. If you need further assistance with creating or refining any of these diagrams, feel free to ask!

Can all these diagrams displayed in UML as well? What is free software to create such diagrams

Yes, all the diagrams mentioned can be created using UML (Unified Modeling Language) and are standard for visualizing different aspects of a system’s architecture and design. To create these UML diagrams, you can use several free software tools that provide robust diagramming capabilities. Here are some recommended tools and a brief overview of each:

Creating UML Diagrams

Here’s a brief overview of how to create each type of diagram with these tools:

    Component Diagram
        Use: To model the system’s components and their interactions.
        Tool Features: Drag and drop components, connect them with interfaces and dependencies.

    Deployment Diagram
        Use: To illustrate the physical deployment of software artifacts on hardware.
        Tool Features: Add nodes (e.g., servers), connect them with deployment artifacts.

    Class Diagram
        Use: To show the static structure of the system, including classes and relationships.
        Tool Features: Define classes, attributes, methods, and relationships (associations, generalizations).

    Sequence Diagram
        Use: To detail the sequence of messages exchanged between objects.
        Tool Features: Define objects, interactions, and the order of message exchanges.

    Activity Diagram
        Use: To model workflows or business processes.
        Tool Features: Create activities, decisions, and flows to represent process steps.

    State Diagram
        Use: To show the states of an object and transitions between these states.
        Tool Features: Define states, transitions, and events triggering state changes.

    Package Diagram
        Use: To organize and group related classes or components.
        Tool Features: Create packages, add elements to packages, and define dependencies between packages.

    Interaction Overview Diagram
        Use: To provide an overview of interactions in the system.
        Tool Features: Combine elements from sequence and activity diagrams to represent high-level interaction flows.
