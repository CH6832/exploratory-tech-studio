"""execution_simulation.py

A simplified version of a simulation-based execution system with logging and a basic monitoring optimization system.
This example focuses on generating random trade signals and simulating their execution within a specified timeframe.

NOTE: The python file is a standalone and serves as a draft for later implementations.
