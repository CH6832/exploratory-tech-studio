# Blockchain Project

This project is a simplified implementation of a blockchain system with proof of stake (PoS), proof of work (PoW), and basic network capabilities. The project demonstrates how to create a basic blockchain, handle transactions with digital signatures, and synchronize the blockchain across nodes in a network.

## Features

- **Blockchain Management**: Basic blockchain with block validation and transaction management.
- **Transactions**: Support for transactions with digital signatures using RSA encryption.
- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Mining mechanism to add new blocks.
- **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: Validator selection based on stake.
- **Networking**: Basic network capabilities to connect nodes and broadcast new blocks.

## Prerequisites

- **OpenSSL**: For cryptographic functions like RSA encryption and SHA-256 hashing.
- **CMake**: For building the project.
- **Google Test**: For running unit tests.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
