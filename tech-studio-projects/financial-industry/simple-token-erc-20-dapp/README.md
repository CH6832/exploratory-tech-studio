# Simple ERC-20 Token dApp

A decentralized application (dApp) for interacting with an ERC-20 token smart contract. This application allows users to view their token balance, send tokens to other addresses, and interact with the Ethereum blockchain using MetaMask.

## Project Overview

This project is a dApp that demonstrates the functionalities of an ERC-20 token. It provides a simple user interface to interact with the token smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can:

- **View Token Balance:** Check their current token balance.
- **Send Tokens:** Transfer tokens to other addresses.

The dApp uses MetaMask for Ethereum wallet management and Web3.js for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. IPFS is used for decentralized file storage, although this example does not include file upload functionalities.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity:** Programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Truffle:** Development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for Ethereum.
- **Web3.js:** JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **MetaMask:** Browser extension for managing Ethereum accounts and interacting with dApps.
- **IPFS:** Decentralized file storage (included in the project but not utilized in the basic implementation).
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** For building the frontend of the dApp.

## How It Works

1. **Smart Contract:**
   - Written in Solidity, the `SimpleToken` contract extends the ERC-20 standard provided by OpenZeppelin.
   - The contract allows users to check their balance and transfer tokens.

2. **Deployment:**
   - The contract is deployed to a local Ethereum blockchain (Ganache) using Truffle.
   - The migration file ensures that the contract is deployed with an initial supply of tokens.

3. **Frontend:**
   - The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - The `app.js` file uses Web3.js to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and the deployed smart contract.
   - MetaMask is used for account management and signing transactions.

4. **IPFS (Optional):**
   - IPFS is included for future enhancements where you might want to store files or additional data in a decentralized manner.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-erc20-dapp.git
   cd simple-erc20-dapp
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install -g truffle
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Ganache:**
   - Download and run [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) to create a local blockchain for testing.

4. **Compile and Migrate Contracts:**

   ```bash
   truffle compile
   truffle migrate
   ```

5. **Start the Frontend:**
   - Open `frontend/index.html` in a web browser.

## Usage

1. **Connect MetaMask:**
   - Ensure MetaMask is installed and connected to the local blockchain (Ganache).

2. **Interact with the dApp:**
   - **View Balance:** The application displays the token balance of the connected account.
   - **Send Tokens:** Enter a recipient address and an amount, then click the "Send Tokens" button to transfer tokens.

```

## Testing and Deployment

1. **Testing:**
   - Use Truffle to write and run tests for your smart contracts to ensure they work as expected.

   ```bash
   truffle test
   ```

2. **Deployment to Mainnet:**
   - Configure Truffle to use a service like Infura to deploy your contract to the Ethereum mainnet.
   - Update the `truffle-config.js` file with your Infura project ID and wallet credentials.

3. **IPFS Integration:**
   - To integrate IPFS, use the IPFS JavaScript client to upload files and interact with the IPFS network.
