# Project Requirements

## Project Overview

The **e-filing-us-gaap** system aims to simplify the process of financial reporting, focusing on ensuring **US GAAP** compliance for businesses and facilitating **SEC filings** through a robust, scalable architecture. This project will use a **Microservices Architecture** for the backend, **Micro-Frontends** for the frontend, and will leverage modern technologies to support financial calculations, reporting, and secure data submission to the **U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)**.

## Project Objectives

- Implement a system that provides **financial reporting**, **regulatory compliance**, and **SEC filing capabilities** based on **US GAAP** standards.
- Build **independent microservices** for backend logic (e.g., financial data management, user authentication) and **micro-frontends** for the user interface (UI).
- Utilize **Spring Boot** for backend development and **Angular.js**, **React**, **Vue.js**, and other frontend frameworks for frontend microservices.
- Integrate **advanced financial calculations** for reporting and regulatory compliance, including the ability to generate financial statements (balance sheets, income statements) and prepare SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q forms).
- Ensure that the system is **scalable**, **secure**, and follows modern best practices for development, deployment, and maintenance.

  - Enable users to update personal and business information.
  - Maintain historical records of user activities.

### 2. **Financial Reporting Service (Backend)**

- **Financial Statement Generation**:
  - Implement logic to generate key financial reports based on **US GAAP**: Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement, etc.
  - Handle complex calculations like **revenue recognition**, **depreciation**, **amortization**, and **tax calculations**.

- **Financial Ratios & Metrics**:
  - Calculate financial ratios like **ROA**, **ROE**, **Current Ratio**, **Quick Ratio**, etc.
  - Implement tools to analyze the financial health of an organization based on these metrics.

### 3. **Filing Service (Backend)**

- **SEC Filing**:
  - Automate the preparation of SEC forms such as **10-K**, **10-Q**, and others.
  - Ensure the system adheres to **XBRL** (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) standards for e-filing to the SEC.
  - Integrate with the **EDGAR** submission system for automated filing.

- **Validation and Error Checking**:
  - Implement mechanisms to ensure that the prepared SEC filings are complete and comply with all regulatory requirements before submission.

### 4. **Compliance & Audit Service (Backend)**

- **Regulatory Compliance Monitoring**:
  - Track **US GAAP compliance** for financial reports.
  - Provide audit logs and detailed records of financial data changes.

- **Threshold and Limit Checking**:
  - Calculate whether a company meets thresholds for mandatory SEC filings or specific financial disclosures.
  - Ensure compliance with **Sarbanes-Oxley** and other relevant regulations.

### 5. **Frontend (Micro-Frontends)**

- **Micro-Frontend Architecture**:
  - The frontend will consist of multiple microservices, each developed using different frontend technologies (e.g., **Angular**, **React**, **Vue.js**).
  - These micro-frontends will be integrated dynamically via an **App Shell** that loads the appropriate microservice depending on the user's interactions.

- **User Profile Micro-Frontend (Angular)**:
  - Handle user registration, profile management, and authentication flows.

- **Financial Reporting Micro-Frontend (React)**:
  - Display and interact with financial reports, including visualizations for key metrics, balances, and historical performance.

- **Filing Micro-Frontend (Vue.js)**:
  - Provide forms for generating SEC filings, reviewing report data, and submitting forms to the SEC.
  - Handle **XBRL** conversion for SEC filing.

- **Compliance Micro-Frontend (Svelte)**:
  - Display compliance and audit logs.
  - Allow users to track regulatory adherence and view audit history.

### 6. **Data and Validation**

- **Data Accuracy and Integrity**:
  - Ensure that all financial data entered into the system is validated against US GAAP standards.
  - Implement error detection mechanisms for detecting discrepancies or inconsistencies in the data.

- **Mathematical Calculations**:
  - **Depreciation and Amortization**: Implement algorithms for calculating depreciation (e.g., straight-line method) and amortization schedules.
  - **Revenue Recognition**: Apply US GAAP rules for recognizing revenue based on performance obligations.
  - **Tax and Interest Calculations**: Provide accurate calculations for taxes and loan interest payments.
  - **Ratios and Metrics**: Compute financial ratios like **Return on Assets (ROA)**, **Debt-to-Equity** ratio, and other key performance indicators.

### 7. **Security and Compliance**

- **Data Encryption**:
  - Ensure end-to-end encryption for sensitive financial data both in transit and at rest.

- **Authentication & Authorization**:
  - Secure all user interactions with OAuth2-based authentication and role-based access control.
  - Support for **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** to enhance security.

- **Auditing & Logging**:
  - Maintain comprehensive audit logs for all user actions, including financial report modifications, SEC filing submissions, and system configurations.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. **Backend (Microservices Architecture)**

- **Technology Stack**:
  - **Java** with **Spring Boot** for backend microservices.
  - **Spring Security** for securing microservices.
  - **Spring Data JPA** or **Hibernate** for database access.
  - **Spring Cloud** (if needed) for service discovery and management.
  - **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** as the relational database for storing financial data.

- **API Communication**:
  - Use **RESTful APIs** or **gRPC** for communication between microservices.
  - Implement **API Gateway** (e.g., using Spring Cloud Gateway or Zuul) for routing and security.

- **Deployment**:
  - Microservices will be containerized using **Docker**.
  - Use **Kubernetes** or **Docker Swarm** for orchestration and scaling.
  - **CI/CD** pipelines will be established using **Jenkins**, **GitLab CI**, or **GitHub Actions**.
