# GAAPCalcPro

## Project Overview

GAAPCalcPro is a financial application designed to perform complex calculations related to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The application is built using modern technologies to ensure robustness and ease of use. It provides accurate and efficient calculations for financial data, helping users adhere to GAAP standards.

## Technologies Used

- **.NET 8.0**: The application is developed using the .NET 8.0 framework, which provides a robust runtime environment and extensive libraries for building scalable and high-performance applications.
- **ASP.NET Core**: Utilized for creating the web-based interface of the application.
- **Blazor**: Used for building interactive web UIs with C# instead of JavaScript, providing a rich user experience.
- **Visual Studio Community Edition**: The project was created and developed using Visual Studio Community Edition, which offers a comprehensive IDE for building .NET applications.
- **Docker**: Employed for containerization, which ensures consistency across different environments and simplifies deployment and scaling.
- **Windows Nano Server**: The base image used for the Docker container, providing a lightweight and secure environment for running the application.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker Desktop**: Required to build and run the Docker container. Download and install it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
- **.NET SDK 8.0**: Ensure you have the .NET SDK 8.0 installed if you plan to build or modify the project. You can download it from the [.NET official website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0).
- **Visual Studio Community Edition**: Needed if you want to modify the project or view the source code. Download it from [Visual Studio's official website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/).

## Getting Started

### Building the Docker Image
