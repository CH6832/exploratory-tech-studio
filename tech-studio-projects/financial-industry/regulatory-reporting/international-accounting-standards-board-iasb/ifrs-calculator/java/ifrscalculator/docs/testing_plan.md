# Testing Plan

## Unit Testing
- **Objective**: Verify that individual methods and classes function as expected.
- **Tools**: JUnit 5
- **Scope**: Each calculation module, logging, and error handling.

### Test Cases
1. **FairValueCalculation**:
   - Verify correct calculation with sample inputs.
   - Test edge cases (e.g., zero or negative values).

2. **AllocateRevenueCalculation**:
   - Test allocation based on various selling prices and transaction values.
   - Validate with different numbers of products.

3. **LeaseLiabilityCalculation**:
   - Verify with different lease payment arrays and discount rates.

4. **PresentValueObligationCalculation**:
   - Check calculations with different benefit payments and discount rates.

5. **DeferredTaxCalculation**:
   - Test with different carrying amounts, tax bases, and tax rates.

6. **GoodwillCalculation**:
   - Validate with various purchase prices and fair value inputs.

7. **RecoverableAmountCalculation**:
   - Test with different fair value, cost to sell, and value in use inputs.

## Integration Testing
- **Objective**: Ensure that the components work together as expected.
- **Scope**: Interaction between GUI and calculation modules.
- **Tools**: JUnit 5, GUI testing tools (e.g., AssertJ-Swing).

## System Testing
- **Objective**: Validate the complete system in a production-like environment.
- **Scope**: Overall functionality, performance, and user experience.
- **Tools**: Manual testing, performance testing tools.

## Acceptance Testing
- **Objective**: Confirm that the tool meets business requirements.
- **Scope**: Test all major functionalities and user interactions.
- **Tools**: Manual testing, user feedback.
