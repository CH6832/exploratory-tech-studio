# Project Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive requirements for the trading system project. The goal is to develop a high-performance, scalable, and secure trading platform that meets both functional and non-functional needs, ensuring a seamless experience for users while adhering to industry regulations.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Real-Time Order Processing
- **Low Latency**: The system must support low-latency order processing to ensure that trades are executed with minimal delay, providing competitive advantage in the market.
- **Order Types**: The platform must support multiple order types, including market orders, limit orders, stop-loss orders, and trailing stop orders.
- **Order Matching**: The system must include an order-matching engine that efficiently matches buy and sell orders based on price-time priority.

### 2. User Interface for Order Submission and Monitoring
- **Intuitive User Interface (UI)**: The system should provide a user-friendly interface that allows traders to easily submit, modify, and cancel orders. The UI should be responsive and accessible across different devices (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Real-Time Updates**: Users must receive real-time updates on the status of their orders, including confirmations of executions, partial fills, and rejections.
- **Customizable Dashboards**: Users should be able to customize their dashboards to monitor specific assets, view order histories, and track market data.
- **Advanced Charting Tools**: The UI should include advanced charting tools for technical analysis, allowing users to apply indicators, draw trend lines, and analyze market movements.

### 3. High-Volume Trade and Order Handling
- **Scalability**: The system must be capable of handling thousands of orders per second during peak trading times, without degradation in performance.
- **Bulk Order Processing**: The system should support bulk order submissions, allowing users to place large volumes of orders simultaneously.
- **Error Handling and Recovery**: The platform should have robust error handling mechanisms to ensure that any issues encountered during order processing are resolved quickly, with minimal impact on users.

### 4. Market Data Integration
- **Real-Time Market Data**: The system should integrate with multiple market data providers to offer real-time price quotes, trade volumes, and other relevant market information.
- **Historical Data Access**: Users should be able to access historical market data for backtesting strategies and conducting in-depth analysis.
- **News and Alerts**: The platform should include a news feed and alert system to notify users of significant market events and changes.

### 5. Reporting and Analytics
- **Performance Reports**: The system should generate detailed performance reports for users, including metrics like win/loss ratios, average trade durations, and return on investment (ROI).
- **Tax Reporting**: The platform must provide tools for generating tax reports based on trading activities, compliant with relevant tax regulations.
- **Custom Analytics**: Users should be able to create custom analytics reports to track specific metrics or strategies.

### 6. Compliance and Regulatory Support
- **Regulatory Reporting**: The system must support automated reporting of trades and orders to regulatory bodies, ensuring compliance with financial regulations (e.g., MiFID II, Dodd-Frank).
- **Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML)**: The platform should integrate KYC and AML processes to verify user identities and monitor transactions for suspicious activities.
- **Data Retention and Auditing**: The system must retain user and transaction data as required by law and provide auditing tools to review historical records.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Scalability
- **Horizontal and Vertical Scaling**: The system should support both horizontal scaling (adding more servers) and vertical scaling (upgrading existing servers) to handle increasing loads.
- **Elastic Load Balancing**: Implement elastic load balancing to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers dynamically, ensuring optimal performance.
- **Database Scalability**: The database should be designed to handle large datasets and high query volumes, with support for partitioning, sharding, and replication.

### 2. High Availability and Fault Tolerance
- **Redundancy**: The system should be deployed across multiple geographic regions to ensure redundancy and minimize the impact of localized failures.
- **Automatic Failover**: Implement automatic failover mechanisms that seamlessly switch to backup systems in the event of hardware or software failures.
- **Data Replication and Backup**: Ensure continuous data replication between primary and backup servers, with regular backups to prevent data loss.

### 3. Security
- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data, both at rest and in transit, must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256, RSA).
- **User Authentication**: Implement robust user authentication mechanisms, including Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and OAuth 2.0, to protect user accounts.
- **Access Control**: Enforce strict access control policies, using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to limit access to sensitive features and data based on user roles.
- **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular penetration testing to identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities in the system.
- **Compliance**: The platform must comply with relevant security and privacy regulations, such as GDPR for user data protection and PCI-DSS for handling payment information.

### 4. Performance
- **Latency**: The system should be optimized to minimize latency, ensuring that user actions and order executions occur in real-time.
- **Throughput**: The platform should be capable of processing a high number of transactions per second (TPS) to accommodate peak trading volumes.
- **Resource Utilization**: Optimize resource utilization, including CPU, memory, and network bandwidth, to ensure that the system operates efficiently under load.

### 5. Maintainability
- **Modular Architecture**: The system should be designed with a modular architecture to facilitate easy maintenance, upgrades, and addition of new features.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation should be provided for both the system's internal architecture and its API, making it easier for developers to maintain and extend the platform.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging to track system performance, detect issues early, and support troubleshooting and maintenance activities.

### 6. Usability
- **User Interface Design**: The UI should be designed following usability best practices, ensuring that it is intuitive, consistent, and responsive.
- **Localization and Internationalization**: The system should support multiple languages and regional settings to cater to a global user base.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that the platform is accessible to users with disabilities, following standards like WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).

### 7. Interoperability
- **API Integration**: Provide a well-documented API to allow integration with third-party services, such as market data providers, brokers, and trading bots.
- **Data Formats**: Support common financial data formats (e.g., FIX, CSV, XML) to ensure compatibility with other systems and tools used by traders and institutions.
- **Versioning**: Implement versioning for APIs and services to ensure backward compatibility and smooth transitions during updates.

## Environmental Requirements
- **Development Environment**: The system should be developed and tested in an environment that closely mirrors the production environment, including software versions and configurations.
- **Production Environment**: The production environment should be isolated from the development and testing environments to prevent accidental interference or data leakage.

## Compliance and Regulatory Requirements
- **Financial Regulations**: Ensure that the platform complies with all relevant financial regulations in the regions where it operates, including those related to trading, reporting, and customer protection.
- **Data Privacy**: Adhere to data privacy laws and regulations, such as GDPR, to protect user data and ensure transparency in how data is collected, used, and stored.
