# System Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the technical requirements necessary to deploy and operate the trading platform effectively. These requirements encompass hardware, software, and network specifications to ensure the system's performance, security, and reliability.

## Hardware Requirements

### 1. Processing Power
- **Minimum CPU Cores**: The system should have at least **4 CPU cores** to handle concurrent trading operations, real-time market data processing, and user interactions efficiently.
- **Recommended CPU**: For optimal performance, especially in high-frequency trading scenarios or with large user bases, an **8-core CPU** or higher is recommended, preferably with multi-threading capabilities (e.g., Intel Xeon, AMD Ryzen).

### 2. Memory (RAM)
- **Minimum RAM**: A minimum of **16 GB** of RAM is required to ensure smooth operation under typical load conditions, allowing the system to handle multiple threads and processes concurrently.
- **Recommended RAM**: **32 GB** or more is recommended for environments with heavy data processing needs, multiple simultaneous users, or if the platform is integrated with advanced analytics tools.

### 3. Storage
- **Disk Space**: Adequate disk space is required for storing user data, transaction logs, and system backups. A minimum of **500 GB** of SSD storage is recommended.
- **Storage Type**: **Solid-State Drives (SSD)** are recommended over traditional Hard Disk Drives (HDD) for faster read/write speeds, which are crucial for the low-latency requirements of a trading platform.
- **Backup Storage**: Additional storage should be allocated for regular backups. **At least 1 TB** of backup storage is recommended to store historical data and system snapshots.

### 4. Redundancy and High Availability
- **Power Supply**: The hardware should include redundant power supplies to minimize downtime in the event of a power failure.
- **RAID Configuration**: Implement RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) configurations to ensure data redundancy and improve performance. **RAID 10** is recommended for balancing speed and fault tolerance.

### 5. Hardware Security
- **Hardware Firewalls**: Use dedicated hardware firewalls to protect the server from unauthorized access and network-based attacks.
- **Hardware Security Module (HSM)**: Consider using HSMs for secure key management and cryptographic operations, especially if handling sensitive financial data.

## Software Requirements

### 1. Programming Language and Runtime
- **Java Version**: The platform is built using **Java 11** or higher. Ensure that the Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed and properly configured on the server.
- **Java Virtual Machine (JVM) Tuning**: For high-performance needs, tune the JVM with appropriate settings for heap size, garbage collection, and thread management.

### 2. Database System
- **Supported Databases**: The system requires a compatible relational database management system (RDBMS) such as **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL**.
  - **MySQL**: Version 8.0 or higher is recommended.
  - **PostgreSQL**: Version 12 or higher is recommended.
- **Database Configuration**: The database should be configured with appropriate indexes, partitions, and backup mechanisms to handle high transaction volumes and ensure data integrity.
- **Connection Pooling**: Implement database connection pooling to optimize resource usage and improve application performance.

### 3. Web Server and Application Server
- **Web Server**: **Apache Tomcat** version 9.0 or higher is recommended as the application server for deploying the Java-based web application.
- **Application Server Features**:
  - **SSL/TLS Support**: Ensure that the server is configured with SSL/TLS for secure communications.
  - **Session Management**: Configure session management settings to handle user sessions securely and efficiently.
  - **Load Balancing**: Consider using load balancers (e.g., **HAProxy** or **NGINX**) to distribute traffic across multiple servers and improve availability.

### 4. Operating System
- **Supported OS**: The system should be deployed on a stable and secure operating system. **Linux** (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, CentOS 8) is recommended for its performance, security, and community support.
- **Kernel Tuning**: For high-performance environments, tune the Linux kernel parameters related to networking, memory management, and file handling.
- **Security**: Regularly update the OS with the latest security patches and configure firewall rules to limit access to essential services only.

### 5. Additional Software
- **Monitoring Tools**: Install monitoring tools (e.g., **Prometheus**, **Grafana**) to track system performance, resource usage, and detect anomalies.
- **Logging Framework**: Use a centralized logging framework (e.g., **ELK Stack**: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to aggregate and analyze logs.
- **Backup Software**: Implement automated backup solutions (e.g., **Bacula**, **Amanda**) for regular data backups and disaster recovery.

## Network Requirements

### 1. Internet Connectivity
- **Bandwidth**: The system requires reliable and high-bandwidth internet connectivity to support real-time data streaming, order processing, and user interactions. A minimum of **100 Mbps** is recommended, with **1 Gbps** or higher for larger deployments.
- **Redundancy**: Implement redundant internet connections from different ISPs to ensure continuous availability in case of network outages.

### 2. Network Security
- **Firewall Configuration**: Properly configure firewalls to allow only necessary traffic (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS on port 80/443, database connections) and block all other unauthorized access.
- **Intrusion Detection and Prevention**: Deploy Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to monitor network traffic and prevent attacks.
- **VPN Access**: For remote management, use Virtual Private Network (VPN) solutions to secure access to the system.

### 3. Network Architecture
- **Segmentation**: Implement network segmentation to isolate different components (e.g., database, web server, application server) and limit the impact of potential breaches.
- **Load Balancers**: Use network load balancers to distribute incoming traffic evenly across multiple servers, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

## Security Requirements

### 1. Data Encryption
- **In-Transit**: Use SSL/TLS encryption for all data transmitted over the network, ensuring that sensitive information like login credentials and financial transactions are secure.
- **At-Rest**: Encrypt sensitive data stored in the database using strong encryption standards (e.g., AES-256).

### 2. Access Control
- **User Authentication**: Implement strong user authentication mechanisms, including Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing the system.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Define and enforce roles and permissions to ensure that users have access only to the features and data necessary for their role.

### 3. Compliance and Auditing
- **Audit Logs**: Maintain detailed audit logs of user activity, system changes, and transactions. Ensure these logs are tamper-proof and regularly reviewed.
- **Compliance**: Ensure that the system complies with relevant regulatory standards (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS) based on the region and nature of the platform.
