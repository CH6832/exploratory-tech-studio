# Deployment Documentation

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive information on the deployment process, covering the configurations, procedures, and best practices necessary for deploying the trading system into production. It includes environment setup, software installation, security configurations, and post-deployment activities to ensure the system is successfully deployed and fully operational.

## Deployment Preparation

### 1. Environment Setup

#### Hardware Requirements
- **CPU**: Minimum of 4 CPU cores.
- **Memory**: At least 16 GB of RAM.
- **Disk Space**: Adequate disk space for database storage, application files, and logs.
- **Network**: Reliable network connectivity with appropriate bandwidth.

#### Software Requirements
- **Java**: Java 17 or higher installed.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MySQL installed and configured.
- **Web Server**: Apache Tomcat or similar application server installed.

### 2. Network Configuration

#### Firewall Setup
- **Port Configuration**: Ensure that only necessary ports (e.g., 8080 for the application, 5432 for PostgreSQL) are open and accessible.
- **IP Whitelisting**: Restrict access to the server from trusted IP addresses.

#### Load Balancer Configuration
- **Load Balancing Strategy**: Implement round-robin or least connections load balancing for distributing traffic across multiple servers.
- **Health Checks**: Configure health checks to monitor the availability of backend servers and route traffic accordingly.

### 3. Security Configuration

#### SSL/TLS Encryption
- **Certificate Installation**: Install SSL/TLS certificates on the web server to enable HTTPS and secure communication.
- **Certificate Renewal**: Document the procedure for renewing SSL/TLS certificates before expiration.

#### Authentication and Authorization
- **User Roles**: Define user roles and access levels within the application.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: If required, implement MFA for added security.

#### Data Encryption
- **At-Rest Encryption**: Ensure that sensitive data stored in the database is encrypted.
- **In-Transit Encryption**: Ensure that data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS.

## Deployment Process

### 1. Application Deployment

#### Build and Package
- **Compile Code**: Compile the Java source code using Maven or Gradle.
- **Package Application**: Package the application into a WAR or JAR file for deployment.

#### Deploy to Application Server
- **Deployment Directory**: Copy the packaged application file to the deployment directory of the application server (e.g., `/var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/`).
- **Configuration Files**: Ensure that application configuration files (e.g., `application.properties`) are correctly set up for the production environment.

### 2. Database Configuration

#### Schema Setup
- **Schema Creation**: Execute SQL scripts to create the necessary database schema, tables, and indexes.
- **Initial Data Load**: If applicable, load initial data into the database using SQL scripts or data import tools.

#### Backup Configuration
- **Backup Schedule**: Set up regular database backups using cron jobs or database management tools.
- **Backup Storage**: Ensure that backups are stored securely and are accessible for recovery purposes.

### 3. Monitoring and Logging

#### Monitoring Setup
- **Monitoring Tools**: Install and configure monitoring tools like Prometheus or Grafana to track application performance, resource utilization, and uptime.
- **Alerting**: Set up alerts for critical events, such as server downtime or high CPU usage.

#### Logging Configuration
- **Log Levels**: Set appropriate log levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR) for different environments.
- **Log Rotation**: Configure log rotation to manage log file sizes and prevent disk space exhaustion.

### 4. Post-Deployment Testing

#### Smoke Testing
- **Basic Functionality**: Verify that the application starts up correctly and that key functionalities, such as user login and order submission, are working.
- **Connectivity**: Test database connections and ensure the application can read and write data.

#### Integration Testing
- **End-to-End Workflow**: Test complete workflows, such as order submission, processing, and cancellation, to ensure all components are functioning together as expected.
- **Performance Testing**: Run load tests to verify that the system can handle expected traffic without performance degradation.

## Post-Deployment Activities

### 1. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- **Stakeholder Involvement**: Conduct UAT with key stakeholders to ensure the system meets user requirements and expectations.
- **Issue Resolution**: Address any issues found during UAT, redeploy if necessary, and document any changes made.

### 2. Documentation and Handover

#### Documentation
- **Deployment Logs**: Maintain detailed logs of the deployment process, including any issues encountered and their resolutions.
- **Configuration Documentation**: Document all configurations, including server settings, database connections, and security settings.
- **User Guides**: Provide user documentation and help files to assist end-users in navigating and using the system.

#### Handover to Support Team
- **Support Training**: Conduct training sessions for the support team, covering the deployment process, monitoring tools, and common troubleshooting steps.
- **Documentation Transfer**: Ensure that all relevant documentation is handed over to the support team.

### 3. Post-Deployment Monitoring

#### Continuous Monitoring
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continue to monitor the system for any issues that arise during the initial period after deployment.
- **Performance Tuning**: Adjust configurations and optimize performance based on monitoring data.

#### Feedback Collection
- **User Feedback**: Collect feedback from users to identify any issues or areas for improvement.
- **Stakeholder Review**: Review the deployment with stakeholders and document lessons learned for future deployments.

## Rollback Plan

### Rollback Strategy
- **Version Control**: Keep a copy of the last stable version of the application ready for redeployment.
- **Database Rollback**: Maintain recent database backups to allow for quick restoration if needed.

### Rollback Execution
- **Revert Application**: If critical issues are identified, redeploy the previous stable version of the application.
- **Restore Database**: If necessary, restore the database to its state before the deployment.

### Post-Rollback Activities
- **Incident Analysis**: Analyze the issues that led to the rollback and document the findings.
- **Plan Update**: Update the deployment plan with lessons learned to prevent future rollbacks.
