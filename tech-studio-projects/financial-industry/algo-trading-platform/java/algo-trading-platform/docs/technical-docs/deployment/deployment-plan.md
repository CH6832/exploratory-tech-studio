# Deployment Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the steps required to deploy the trading system into a production environment. It covers preparation, configuration, installation, validation, and post-deployment activities, ensuring a smooth and successful deployment.

## Pre-Deployment Preparations

### 1. Environment Setup
- **Production Environment**: Ensure that the production environment is set up and isolated from the development and testing environments. The production environment should mirror the configuration and software versions of the staging environment.
- **Hardware Provisioning**: Provision the necessary hardware resources, including servers, storage, and network components, as specified in the System Requirements document.
- **Software Installation**: Install and configure the required software, including Java 17, the database system (e.g., PostgreSQL), and the web server (e.g., Apache Tomcat).

### 2. Network Configuration
- **Firewall Rules**: Configure firewall rules to allow only necessary traffic to and from the trading system. Restrict access to sensitive components like databases and application servers.
- **Load Balancing**: Set up load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple application servers, ensuring high availability and optimal performance.
- **DNS Configuration**: Ensure the DNS settings point to the correct IP addresses of the production servers.

### 3. Database Preparation
- **Database Schema Setup**: Create the necessary database schemas, tables, and relationships as defined in the database design documentation.
- **Data Migration**: If applicable, perform data migration from the old system to the new database. Ensure that data integrity is maintained during the migration process.
- **Backup and Recovery Setup**: Implement regular backup schedules and ensure that database recovery mechanisms are in place and tested.

### 4. Security Preparations
- **SSL/TLS Configuration**: Install and configure SSL/TLS certificates to ensure secure communication between clients and the server.
- **User Authentication**: Set up user authentication mechanisms, including Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) if applicable.
- **Access Control**: Define and configure access control policies to limit access to sensitive areas of the system based on user roles.

## Deployment Process

### 1. Application Deployment
- **Package the Application**: Build the application and package it as a deployable artifact (e.g., WAR or JAR file).
- **Deploy to Application Server**: Deploy the packaged application to the application servers (e.g., Apache Tomcat) in the production environment.
- **Configuration Files**: Ensure that all configuration files (e.g., application.properties, log settings) are correctly configured for the production environment.
- **Database Connections**: Verify that the application is correctly configured to connect to the production database.

### 2. Validation and Testing
- **Smoke Testing**: Perform initial smoke testing to verify that the application is running and that key functionalities are working as expected.
- **Integration Testing**: Execute integration tests to ensure that all components of the system (e.g., UI, backend, database) work together seamlessly in the production environment.
- **Performance Testing**: Conduct performance tests to validate that the system can handle the expected load without performance degradation.
- **Security Testing**: Perform security testing to ensure that all security measures, including encryption and authentication, are functioning correctly.

### 3. Monitoring and Logging Setup
- **Monitoring Tools**: Set up monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track system performance, resource utilization, and uptime.
- **Logging Configuration**: Configure logging to capture detailed logs of application activities, errors, and security events. Ensure logs are stored securely and can be accessed for troubleshooting.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Set up alerts for critical events (e.g., server downtime, security breaches) and configure notifications to be sent to the relevant personnel.

## Post-Deployment Activities

### 1. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- **UAT Execution**: Facilitate User Acceptance Testing by key stakeholders to ensure that the system meets user requirements and expectations.
- **Issue Resolution**: Address any issues identified during UAT promptly and redeploy the application if necessary.

### 2. Final Rollout
- **Go-Live**: Once UAT is successful, perform the final rollout of the system. Ensure that all users are informed of the go-live schedule and any necessary downtime.
- **User Training**: Provide training sessions or documentation to end-users, helping them understand how to use the new system effectively.
- **Support Transition**: Transition to the production support phase, ensuring that the support team is prepared to handle any issues that arise post-deployment.

### 3. Post-Deployment Monitoring
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Keep monitoring the system for the first few days after deployment to catch and resolve any unforeseen issues quickly.
- **Performance Tuning**: Based on the monitoring data, perform any necessary performance tuning to optimize system performance.
- **Feedback Collection**: Collect feedback from users and stakeholders to identify areas for improvement or potential future enhancements.

### 4. Backup and Recovery Testing
- **Backup Validation**: Verify that regular backups are being performed as scheduled and that the backup data is intact.
- **Disaster Recovery Drill**: Conduct a disaster recovery drill to ensure that the system can be restored from backups in case of a catastrophic failure.

## Rollback Plan

### 1. Rollback Triggers
- **Critical Failures**: If critical failures are detected that cannot be resolved quickly, initiate the rollback process.
- **Performance Issues**: If the system exhibits significant performance issues that degrade user experience, consider rolling back to the previous stable version.

### 2. Rollback Steps
- **Previous Version Deployment**: Re-deploy the previous stable version of the application using the backup deployment package.
- **Database Restoration**: Restore the database to its state before the deployment using the latest backup.
- **Configuration Reversion**: Revert any configuration changes made during the deployment process.
- **Validation**: Perform testing to ensure that the rollback was successful and the system is functioning as expected.

### 3. Post-Rollback Activities
- **Incident Analysis**: Conduct a thorough analysis to identify the cause of the failure that triggered the rollback.
- **Plan Revisions**: Update the deployment plan based on the lessons learned from the rollback incident.
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Inform all stakeholders about the rollback and the steps being taken to address the issues.

## Documentation and Handover

### 1. Deployment Documentation
- **Deployment Logs**: Maintain detailed logs of all deployment activities, including steps performed, issues encountered, and resolutions applied.
- **Configuration Documentation**: Document all configurations applied in the production environment, including server settings, database connections, and security configurations.
- **Release Notes**: Provide release notes that detail the new features, bug fixes, and improvements included in the deployment.

### 2. Handover to Support
- **Support Handover**: Ensure that the production support team is fully briefed on the deployment, including any potential issues and the resolutions applied.
- **Documentation Transfer**: Transfer all relevant documentation, including deployment logs, configuration files, and backup procedures, to the support team.
- **Final Training**: Provide final training sessions to the support team to ensure they are equipped to handle any post-deployment issues.
