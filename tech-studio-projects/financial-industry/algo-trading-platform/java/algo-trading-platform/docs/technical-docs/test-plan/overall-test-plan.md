### 4.3 System Testing

- **Description**: Validate the complete and integrated system against requirements.
- **Tools**: JUnit 5, Selenium (for UI testing), Custom Test Scripts.
- **Scope**: Complete system, including all integrated modules and interfaces.
- **Test Cases**:
  - Validate system functionality against the requirements document.
  - Perform end-to-end scenarios to ensure workflows are functioning correctly.

### 4.4 Acceptance Testing

- **Description**: Ensure that the system meets business requirements and is ready for deployment.
- **Tools**: User acceptance testing scripts, manual testing.
- **Scope**: Entire system from a user's perspective.
- **Test Cases**:
  - Validate features against user stories and acceptance criteria.
  - Perform exploratory testing based on user scenarios.

### 4.5 Performance Testing

- **Description**: Assess system performance under various load conditions.
- **Tools**: JMeter, LoadRunner.
- **Scope**: System performance, including response times and resource utilization.
- **Test Cases**:
  - Measure system response times under different loads.
  - Identify performance bottlenecks.

### 4.6 Security Testing

- **Description**: Identify vulnerabilities and ensure that security measures are effective.
- **Tools**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.
- **Scope**: Application security, including authentication, authorization, and data protection.
- **Test Cases**:
  - Test for common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
  - Verify that data protection and encryption are in place.

## 5. Testing Environment

### 5.1 Development Environment

- **Purpose**: Used by developers for unit and integration testing.
- **Configuration**: Local machines with necessary development tools and dependencies.

### 5.2 Testing Environment

- **Purpose**: Dedicated environment for system and acceptance testing.
- **Configuration**: A mirror of the production environment with all modules and services integrated.

### 5.3 Production Environment

- **Purpose**: Final environment where performance and security testing are conducted before deployment.
- **Configuration**: Production-like environment to ensure real-world conditions.

## 6. Test Execution

### 6.1 Test Schedule

- **Unit Testing**: Continuous integration; executed with every code change.
- **Integration Testing**: Performed after unit testing, prior to system testing.
- **System Testing**: Conducted after integration testing.
- **Acceptance Testing**: Performed before deployment to production.
- **Performance Testing**: Conducted during the later stages of development and pre-deployment.
- **Security Testing**: Performed before final deployment.

### 6.2 Test Reporting

- **Format**: Test results will be documented in a structured format, including test case ID, description, expected result, actual result, and status.
- **Tools**: Test management tools like TestRail or Jira.

## 7. Test Metrics

- **Test Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by tests.
- **Defect Density**: Number of defects found per module or feature.
- **Pass/Fail Rate**: Ratio of passed tests to failed tests.
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, throughput, and system resource utilization.

## 8. Test Roles and Responsibilities

- **Test Manager**: Oversees the testing process, ensures adherence to the test plan.
- **Test Engineers**: Design and execute test cases, report defects.
- **Developers**: Fix defects identified during testing and support testing efforts.

## 9. Risks and Mitigations

### 9.1 Risks

- **Risk**: Incomplete test coverage.
  - **Mitigation**: Ensure comprehensive test cases are written and reviewed.

- **Risk**: Test environment not mirroring production.
  - **Mitigation**: Regularly update and maintain test environments.

- **Risk**: Performance issues not identified early.
  - **Mitigation**: Perform early and continuous performance testing.

## 10. Conclusion
