# Overall Architecture

## Introduction
This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture for the trading application. It outlines the key components and their interactions.

## Architecture Overview
The system is designed with a modular approach to ensure scalability and maintainability. It consists of several core components:

1. **User Interface**: Provides the interface for users to interact with the system.
2. **Trading Engine**: Handles order processing, matching, and trading logic.
3. **Order Book**: Maintains the list of active orders and manages their states.
4. **Data Storage**: Stores historical data, configurations, and logs.
5. **Logging and Monitoring**: Provides system logging and performance monitoring.

## Component Interactions
The components interact through well-defined APIs and messaging protocols:

- The **User Interface** communicates with the **Trading Engine** to submit and modify orders.
- The **Trading Engine** updates the **Order Book** with the latest order statuses.
- The **Order Book** retrieves and stores order information in **Data Storage**.
- **Logging and Monitoring** tools collect data from all components for analysis.
