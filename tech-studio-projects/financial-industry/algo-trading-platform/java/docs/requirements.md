## Project Overview

Project Name: Algorithmic Trading Platform  
Version: 1.0
Prepared by: Christoph

---

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to design and develop a high-performance, scalable, and secure Algorithmic Trading Platform. The platform will facilitate real-time data ingestion, strategy execution, order management, risk management, and comprehensive data analytics. It should be capable of operating in a live trading environment and support multiple trading strategies with low latency and high throughput.

## Scope of Work

### Core Components

#### Market Data Ingestion  
   - Handle real-time data feeds from multiple sources (e.g., exchanges, brokers, data providers).
   - Support various data formats and protocols (e.g., FIX, WebSocket, REST).
   - Process and normalize data for use by the platform's components.
  
#### Strategy Engine  
   - Execute multiple trading strategies concurrently.
   - Allow users to develop, test, and deploy custom trading algorithms.
   - Support Virtual Threads for efficient concurrency handling.

#### Order Management System (OMS)  
   - Manage the lifecycle of all orders (placement, tracking, and modification).
   - Interface with external brokers/exchanges for order execution.
   - Provide real-time order status and portfolio tracking.

#### Execution Management System (EMS)  
   - Route and execute orders through brokers or directly on exchanges.
   - Implement advanced order types and execution algorithms (e.g., VWAP, TWAP).
   - Provide low-latency, high-throughput connectivity.

#### Risk Management Module  
   - Enforce pre-trade and post-trade risk checks (e.g., exposure limits, order size limits).
   - Monitor real-time compliance with regulatory requirements.
   - Trigger alerts and notifications for risk breaches.

#### Backtesting Engine  
   - Enable historical testing of trading strategies.
   - Provide access to historical data for strategy validation.
   - Ensure accurate simulation of trading conditions.

#### Data Storage and Analytics  
   - Store market data, trades, and other relevant metrics.
   - Provide a data warehouse for historical analysis and reporting.
   - Support time-series analysis for backtesting and performance evaluation.

#### User Interface (UI) & Monitoring  
   - Develop an intuitive and responsive dashboard for system monitoring using Vue.js.
   - Provide real-time metrics on system health, performance, and risk exposure.
   - Enable configurable alerts and notifications.

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance  
   - Latency: System latency should be under 10 milliseconds for order processing.
   - Throughput: Support a minimum of 10,000 orders per second.
  
#### Scalability  
   - Horizontal scalability to handle increased data and order volumes.
  
#### Security  
   - Implement robust authentication and authorization.
   - Comply with regulatory standards for data protection (e.g., GDPR).
  
#### Availability  
   - 99.99% uptime requirement for production environments.
  
#### Reliability  
   - Built-in failover and redundancy mechanisms to ensure system reliability.

## Technology Stack

### Programming Language

- Java 21 LTS: Chosen for its stability, performance, and Virtual Threads support, which will optimize concurrency handling.
- Vue.js: Chosen for its flexibility and lightweight footprint, ideal for creating a responsive, real-time dashboard interface.

### Frameworks and Libraries

- Spring Boot: For dependency injection, RESTful API management, and modular component development.
- Apache Kafka: For real-time data streaming, market data ingestion, and event-driven architecture.
- Netty or Akka: For high-performance network communication, especially for order routing and data transmission.
- Hazelcast or Redis: For distributed caching and state management.
- TimescaleDB or InfluxDB: For efficient time-series data storage and querying.
  
### Database and Storage

- Relational Database: PostgreSQL for transactional data (orders, trades, portfolio).
- NoSQL Database: MongoDB or Cassandra for high-throughput market data storage.
  
### Deployment and Orchestration

- Docker: Containerization for consistent environment configuration.
- Kubernetes: For container orchestration, scaling, and deployment automation.
- Prometheus and Grafana: For real-time monitoring, metrics collection, and visualization.
