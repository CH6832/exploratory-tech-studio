**Title**: System Architecture Overview

---

#### **1.1 Introduction**

The architecture of the algorithmic trading platform leverages a **hybrid architecture** combining both a **Core Monolithic Application** and **Microservices**. This combination allows for the optimization of low-latency, tightly coupled core trading operations while providing the flexibility, scalability, and modularity required for additional services through microservices.

- **Core Monolithic Application**: The core application provides a centralized, high-performance system that handles key aspects of trading and market data processing, while ensuring fast execution times.
- **Microservices**: These modular services are designed to scale independently, handle auxiliary tasks like user management and notifications, and facilitate more agile and fault-tolerant operations.

#### **1.2 Core Monolithic Application**

The **Core Monolithic Application** contains the main logic of the trading platform, handling critical operations such as strategy execution, order management, risk monitoring, and market data processing.

- **Trading Engine**: This is the heart of the platform, responsible for processing strategies, executing orders, managing positions, and assessing risks associated with trades.
  - Key Functions: Strategy execution, order placement, stop-loss logic, and position updates.
  
- **Market Data Processing**: Handles the ingestion of real-time market data streams and the storage of historical data for backtesting and real-time analysis.
  - Key Functions: Market data collection, storage (e.g., time-series data), and feeding live data to the trading engine.
  
- **Portfolio Management**: Manages user portfolios, tracks assets, positions, and account balances, and ensures that funds are properly allocated across different assets.
  - Key Functions: Balance management, portfolio updates, margin tracking.

#### **1.3 Microservices**

Microservices are used to handle auxiliary services that are non-critical but require flexibility, scalability, and fault tolerance. The microservice architecture ensures that these services can evolve independently from the core system and scale according to demand.

- **User Management**: This service handles user authentication, authorization, and management of user-specific data.
  - Key Functions: User registration, login, token-based authentication (JWT), profile management.
  
- **Data Retrieval**: Retrieves market data from external sources, caches frequently accessed data for efficiency, and ensures seamless data flow into the trading engine.
  - Key Functions: External API data fetch, caching layer, market data storage, and management.

- **Reporting**: Generates and serves performance reports, trading history, and other key metrics to the users.
  - Key Functions: Trade logs, performance analysis, transaction reports, tax reports.

- **Notification Service**: Handles real-time notifications, such as order execution updates, trade alerts, and risk threshold warnings.
  - Key Functions: Push notifications, email alerts, SMS, and in-app messaging.

#### **1.4 Communication and Integration**

The communication between the **Core Monolithic Application** and the **Microservices** is achieved through a **message broker** (e.g., RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka) to ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and asynchronous communication. The use of **REST APIs** enables synchronous communication for request-response based interactions.

- **Frontend Communication**: The **Frontend UI** communicates with the backend through **REST APIs** for standard requests such as placing orders, fetching reports, or checking user balances. For real-time updates (e.g., live price data or order status), the frontend uses **WebSockets** to subscribe to events and receive continuous updates without polling.

**Title**: Data Flow Diagrams

---

#### **2.1 Overview**

This document visualizes the flow of data throughout the platform, starting from external data providers, passing through the core application for processing, and ultimately being served to the frontend for real-time user interaction. The flow diagrams below provide a detailed view of how market data, trades, and user interactions are handled within the system.

---

#### **2.2 Real-Time Data Pipeline**

The **Real-Time Data Pipeline** represents the flow of market data from external data providers into the system, where it is processed by the core trading application and delivered to the frontend via WebSockets for live updates.

**Key Components**:
- **Market Data Provider**: Provides raw market data (e.g., price, volume, bid-ask).
- **Data Ingestion Layer**: This layer collects and processes data using technologies like **Kafka** or **WebSocket** for streaming.
- **Core Trading Application**: Processes the data and provides necessary feeds (e.g., price updates, indicators).
- **Frontend UI**: Displays real-time market information to the user.

#### **2.3 Trade Execution Flow**

The **Trade Execution Flow** illustrates the steps involved in processing a user trade request, from order placement to execution on an exchange. It outlines how orders are routed and executed by the trading engine and ultimately sent to the exchange or market venue for fulfillment.

**Key Components**:
- **Frontend UI**: The user places an order.
- **API Gateway**: Handles incoming requests and forwards them to the trading engine.
- **Core Trading Engine**: Validates the order, performs risk checks, and prepares the order for execution.
- **Market Access Layer**: Routes the order to the appropriate exchange or market venue for execution.
