# Algorithmic Trading System

## Overview

This project is an **Algorithmic Trading System** designed for executing trading strategies in financial markets. It includes a simulation of key components such as market data processing, order execution, risk management, and trading strategy evaluation. The system is designed with **performance**, **low-latency**, and **scalability** in mind, making it suitable for real-time trading environments. 

The **core system** has been implemented so far, with the following major components:

- **Market Data Processor**
- **Trading Engine**
- **Order Execution**
- **Risk Management**
- **Market Feed Handler**
- **Trading Strategy**

The system is designed to simulate the process of receiving market data, evaluating trading strategies, executing orders, and managing risk.

## Key Components

### 1. **Market Data Processor**
- Responsible for processing incoming market data.
- Uses low-latency techniques to ensure fast processing and minimal delays.
- Logs every step of data processing for traceability.

### 2. **Trading Engine**
- The core engine that coordinates trading activities.
- It integrates the **Trading Strategy** and **Order Execution** components.
- It evaluates the strategy and executes orders based on the decisions made by the strategy.
- It is built to handle multiple trading cycles and ensure smooth operation in a low-latency environment.

### 3. **Order Execution**
- Simulates the execution of trade orders.
- Ensures orders are executed promptly, logging both successes and failures.
- Handles simple buy orders and can be extended to handle different order types.

### 4. **Risk Management**
- Assesses the risk involved in executing a particular trade.
- Determines if a trade should be executed based on its risk profile.
- Ensures that no risky trades are executed based on pre-configured risk thresholds.

### 5. **Market Feed Handler**
- Simulates the ingestion of market data.
- Works in conjunction with the **Market Data Processor** to handle incoming market information.
- Processes market data to help make informed decisions based on the trading strategy.

### 6. **Trading Strategy**
- Contains the logic for decision-making in trading.
- Evaluates the current market data and outputs a trade decision.
- Currently, it simulates a basic buy decision, but it can be extended to more sophisticated strategies.

## Current Implementation

The core system has been implemented with basic components working in conjunction. The system flow is as follows:

1. **Market Feed Handler** receives market data.
2. The **Market Data Processor** processes the market data.
3. The **Trading Engine** evaluates a trade decision based on the **Trading Strategy**.
4. The **Risk Management** module assesses whether the trade is acceptable.
5. If the trade is deemed acceptable, the **Order Execution** component executes the trade.
6. The trading engine logs every step of this cycle for debugging and performance tracking.

### Performance and Low Latency Focus

- **Logging and Profiling**: Every step is logged for debugging and analysis, ensuring traceability.
- **Jitter Avoidance**: The system handles market data with minimal jitter, making it suitable for real-time trading environments.
- **GC Optimization**: Efforts are made to minimize garbage collection overhead to ensure consistent low-latency performance.
- **Error Handling**: Exception handling is incorporated throughout to ensure robustness in various scenarios.

### Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Trading Strategies**: The basic "buy" strategy can be replaced with more complex algorithms, such as **mean reversion**, **momentum-based strategies**, and **market-making** strategies.
- **Backtesting Framework**: A framework for backtesting strategies using historical market data will be implemented to assess strategy performance before live deployment.
- **Integration with Real Market Data Feeds**: The system can be extended to integrate with live market data providers for actual trading.
- **Risk Management Enhancements**: More advanced risk assessment tools, such as stop-loss limits, risk/reward ratios, and portfolio diversification, can be added.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that **Java 17+** is installed.
3. Navigate to the project directory and build the project:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
4. Run the system (simulating a trading cycle):
    ```bash
    java -cp target/your-artifact-name.jar com.system.algotrading.Main
    ```
5. The trading cycle will execute, logging the decisions made by each component.

## Running Tests

To run the unit tests (using **JUnit 5**):

```bash
mvn test
```

This will run all tests, verifying the integrity and behavior of each component of the system.
