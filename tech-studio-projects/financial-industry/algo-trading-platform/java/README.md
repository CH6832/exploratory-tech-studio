# Algo Trading System

## Overview

The Trading System Project is a robust and scalable solution designed for real-time order processing and trading operations. It encompasses various components including a trading engine, order book management, and a user interface to facilitate trading activities. The system is engineered to handle high volumes of trades efficiently while maintaining performance and reliability.

## How the Project Works

The Trading System is structured into several core components:

1. **Trading Engine Server**: The heart of the system, responsible for executing trading operations and managing the order book.
2. **Order Book**: Maintains and manages active orders, ensuring they are correctly matched and processed.
3. **User Interface**: Provides users with a way to interact with the system, submit orders, and view order statuses.
4. **Data Storage**: Stores historical data, user information, and logs for the system.
5. **Logging and Monitoring**: Handles system logging and performance monitoring to ensure smooth operations and facilitate debugging.

### Key Processes:
- **Order Submission**: Users submit orders through the User Interface, which are then processed by the Trading Engine and recorded in the Order Book.
- **Order Matching**: The Trading Engine matches buy and sell orders from the Order Book, executing trades as needed.
- **Logging**: All activities are logged for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.

## How to Build and Run the Project

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven (for dependency management and building the project)
- Eclipse IDE for Java Developers (or any other preferred Java IDE)

### Building the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trading-system.git
   cd trading-system
   ```

2. **Build with Maven**:
   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   ```

### Running the Project

1. **Start the Trading Engine Server**:
   ```sh
   java -cp target/trading-system.jar com.fintech.algotrading.tradingserverengine.TradingEngineServer
   ```

2. **Launch the User Interface**:
   (Instructions for launching the UI will depend on how it's implemented. For a web-based UI, you might need to start a web server or open a web browser.)

## How to Run the Tests

### Unit Tests

1. **Run Unit Tests with Maven**:
   ```sh
   mvn test
   ```

### Integration Tests

1. **Run Integration Tests with Maven**:
   ```sh
   mvn verify
   ```

### Performance and Security Tests

- **Performance Tests**: Execute performance test scripts located in the `tests/performance` directory.
- **Security Tests**: Conduct security assessments using tools integrated with the CI/CD pipeline.
