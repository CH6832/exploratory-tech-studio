### **Title**: System Architecture Overview

---

#### **1.1 Introduction**

The architecture of the algorithmic trading platform is designed with a **hybrid architecture**, combining a **Core Monolithic Application** and **Microservices**. This design allows the optimization of low-latency core trading operations while providing flexibility, scalability, and modularity for auxiliary services.

- **Core Monolithic Application**: The core application handles key trading operations and market data processing, ensuring fast execution times.
- **Microservices**: These modular services handle non-critical tasks, offering scalability and fault tolerance.

---

#### **1.2 Core Monolithic Application**

The **Core Monolithic Application** handles the essential functionalities of the trading platform, including strategy execution, order management, risk monitoring, and market data processing.

- **Trading Engine**: Central to the platform, the trading engine is responsible for executing strategies, placing orders, managing positions, and assessing risk.
  - Key Functions: Strategy execution, order placement, stop-loss handling, and position updates.

- **Market Data Processing**: Manages real-time data streams and stores historical data for backtesting and live analysis.
  - Key Functions: Market data collection, storage (e.g., time-series data), and live data feeding to the trading engine.

- **Portfolio Management**: Tracks user portfolios, positions, and balances while managing fund allocation.
  - Key Functions: Balance management, portfolio updates, margin tracking.

#### **1.3 Microservices**

Microservices handle auxiliary tasks requiring flexibility, scalability, and fault tolerance. These services are designed to scale independently from the core system.

- **User Management**: Manages user authentication, authorization, and data.
  - Key Functions: User registration, login, JWT-based authentication, profile management.

- **Data Retrieval**: Fetches and caches market data from external sources, ensuring seamless integration with the trading engine.
  - Key Functions: External API data fetch, caching layer, and market data management.

- **Reporting**: Generates performance reports, trade history, and other key metrics.
  - Key Functions: Trade logs, performance analysis, transaction reports.

- **Notification Service**: Handles notifications for events like order execution updates and risk alerts.
  - Key Functions: Push notifications, email/SMS alerts, and in-app messaging.

#### **1.4 Communication and Integration**

The communication between the **Core Monolithic Application** and the **Microservices** is managed via **message brokers** (e.g., RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka) to enable asynchronous communication. **REST APIs** provide synchronous communication for request-response interactions.

- **Frontend Communication**: The **Frontend UI** communicates with the backend via **REST APIs** for actions like placing orders or fetching reports. For real-time updates (e.g., live prices or order status), the frontend uses **WebSockets** to subscribe to events and receive continuous updates.

**Title**: Data Flow Diagrams

---

#### **2.1 Overview**

This document visualizes the flow of data in the platform, starting from external data providers and passing through the core application for processing, and finally reaching the frontend for real-time interaction. The flow diagrams illustrate how market data, trades, and user interactions are managed within the system.

---

#### **2.2 Real-Time Data Pipeline**

The **Real-Time Data Pipeline** visualizes the flow of market data from external providers to the system, processed by the core trading application, and delivered to the frontend via WebSockets.

**Key Components**:
- **Market Data Provider**: Provides raw market data (e.g., price, volume, bid-ask).
- **Data Ingestion Layer**: Collects and processes data using tools like **Kafka**, **WebSocket**, or custom Python consumers for streaming.
- **Core Trading Application**: Processes the data and generates necessary feeds (e.g., price updates, indicators).
- **Frontend UI**: Displays real-time market information to the user.

#### **2.3 Trade Execution Flow**

The **Trade Execution Flow** illustrates the steps involved in processing a user trade request, from order placement to execution.

**Key Components**:
- **Frontend UI**: User places an order.
- **API Gateway**: Forwards the order request to the core trading engine.
- **Core Trading Engine**: Validates the order, performs risk checks, and prepares the order for execution.
- **Market Access Layer**: Routes the order to the exchange for fulfillment.
